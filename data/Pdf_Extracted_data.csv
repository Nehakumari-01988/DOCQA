ABSTRACT: Alcohol consumption is known to be an addiction that provides negative outcomes mainly on
health, excessive drinking of alcohol brings adverse effects on human health, also on activities that focus on
school performance. This research aims to examine the link between alcohol use and the academic success of
high school students. The results of the related studies were carried out and found that binge drinking of alcohol
brings adverse effects and negative impacts on the academic attainment of undergraduate learners. The findings
of this paper recommend that daily consultation is suggested to reduce the addiction to alcohol drinking and
enhance students' work rate in their academic success. These findings validated that drinking alcohol brings
negative outcomes on students’ health and in their learning areas.

I. INTRODUCTION
Overindulgence in alcohol is a widespread harmful habit globally, and it is a particularly prevalent
issue among young people who view alcohol as a form of leisure activity [1]. Consumption of alcohol among
scholars is generally perceived as socially important content and is a reason for worries among numerous
parents and academy directors. The drinking patterns of young students tend to be inconsistent and fluctuate
depending on the season and days of the week. In actuality, a pattern of consistent drinking must be established
in adulthood before it can be classified as a dependence issue [2]. Previous studies indicated that alcohol
consumption has a detrimental effect on the academic performance of students, as it can make it difficult for
them to manage their academic responsibilities and social life, leading to a high risk of dropping out or failing
classes. Excessive alcohol consumption has also been associated with negative health impacts, including
automobile crashes, accidental injuries, and fatalities. On the negative, some inquiries have shown that drinking
alcohol has no notable effect on the pupil’s performance [3]. The dangers of excessive or binge drinking not
only affect the drinkers themselves, but also those around them [4]. A widely accepted and comprehensive
indicator of academic performance among high school students is their Grade Point Average or GPA [5]. Only
many studies have studied the connection between alcohol input and GPA. Commonly, binge drinking and
alcohol-related goods in council scholars constitute serious enterprises in several countries. Similar data have
revealed that, in advanced education, there is a high degree of association between undergraduate students'
alcohol consumption and their academic performance, with higher levels of alcohol use being associated with
lower levels of academic achievement. [6].
A study in the United States investigated the impact of alcohol binge drinking and students' self-
reported GPA. By performing separate regression analysis using OLS with marijuana and alcohol use as
variables, and joint regression analysis with both drugs as variables. It was discovered that both of these
variables affected students' GPAs. Previous studies have demonstrated the widespread use of alcohol among
college students, with many participating in drinking [7]. According to the paper by Balsa, Gandelman, and
Roldán [8], the extent to which the influence of peers and parents on adolescent drinking behavior and academic
achievement are related, and whether one group has a greater impact than the other. They also looked at how
these two factors interact and whether they complement or replace each other. In that study, an average of test
scores was used to proxy intellectual capabilities, and an assessment of the rate of alcohol intake in the previous
30 days was used to proxy risky behavior. For both males and females, the likelihood of having average or
above-average academic performance decreases significantly as the frequency of reported alcohol consumption
per month increases, when compared to those who do not drink. Furthermore, when compared to non-drinkers,
the likelihood of having average or above-average academic performance significantly decreased with higher

alcohol consumption. Additionally, the likelihood of having average or above-average academic performance
only decreases significantly when there is a frequency of severe alcohol intoxication of 1-2 days per month [9].
Based on the study's findings, a huge percentage of respondents were between the ages of 15 and 35, when
dangerous behavior like heavy alcohol use is widespread. The main reasons for drinking alcohol, are for fun,
staying awake, and courage (being able to interact with lecturers and convey a public talk). Students consume
alcohol to cope with stress, stay alert for late-night studying, or as a form of self-treatment for illness. The study
found that the participants are individuals who drink alcohol frequently, both daily and weekly. As a result,
contrive means to consume the substance, without which life is devoid of the happiest. The study found that the
majority of participants consumed more bottles of alcohol in a single sitting, which could be considered alcohol
abuse. A previous study investigated the impact of alcohol drinking on students' academic performance [10].
Onyebuchukwu, Sholarin, and Chico [11] conducted a study with 30 students to assess the dependability and
accuracy of the study's survey instruments. The study included 200 participants, 114 males and 86 females
ranging in age from 13 to 25 years. The study indicates that there's a strong link between alcohol consumption
and academic performance, a notable contrast in academic outcomes between drinkers and non-drinkers, and
alcohol has a significant impact on academic performance. In Finland, a significant portion of students reported
consuming alcohol for extended periods and in large quantities (46% and 50%, respectively). Additionally, a
high percentage of students reported drinking frequently (41%), excessive drinking (66%), problematic drinking
(29%), and possible alcohol dependence (9%). After adjusting for other variables, gender was related to all
alcohol use behaviors, followed by a level of religiosity (related to different alcohol behaviors), living situation,
civil status, age (each associated with alcohol behavior patterns), and parental involvement and year of study
[12]. A large percentage of students (68%) believe that alcohol rehabilitation facilities are available on campus.
This indicates that the institution's caregivers were aware of the poor reputation of alcohol consumption long
before the CHE inspection revealed the problem. For some rationale, the problem has been left to fester and is
clearly out of control. A significant number of students are terrified as a result of drunken students' behavior.
However, after taking into consideration unobserved factors and controlling for them, the results showed that
binge drinking can have a slightly negative impact on academic performance, particularly for risk-averse
students, who focused on their future and abstain from drug use [13]. More research is needed to determine
whether there is a link between those who live in fear and educational attainment. However, it would not be
unfair to conclude that this state of mind is likely to provide fertile ground for poor performance. Students
should never be permitted to consume alcohol in a learning environment. Universities must take a strong stance
to ensure that their campuses are alcohol-free zones. The prohibition of alcohol on campus necessitates regular
policing. It is crucial to enforce strict laws regulating alcohol in universities to reduce the negative impact of
alcohol [14]. This is because the effects of alcohol are determined by the duration and amount consumed - the
negative impact on student's cognitive abilities, as measured by academic performance, grows with an increase
in both the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption [15]. This is a minor price to pay to ensure our
children's safety and success [16].
The purpose of this study is to examine the association between alcohol use (during the week or on
weekends) and the academic performance of students. And to identify the best set of significantly associated
variables for understanding students' final grades. The main objectives of this research are to determine the
impact of alcohol on students' final grades and to identify other key factors affecting their grades or school
performance.
Objectives of the Study
The objective of this study is to identify the effects influencing learner education with alcohol use that
may impact the quality of their learning, particularly their academic performance. It will also be investigated
what other negative effects alcohol has on students, particularly college students. In this literature review, we
will discuss the reasons why teenagers drink alcohol and the forces that encourage them to continue drinking
despite the risks. Aside from that, strategies for reducing alcohol consumption will be investigated.
II. METHODS
A literature review is an academic document that summarizes and evaluates the current research on a
specific topic, by considering the available literature in the field. A literature review examines books, scholarly
articles, and other relevant sources about a specific topic, area of study, or theory [17]. If you are short on time,
a review of the literature can serve as an overview for your investigation. Literature reviews are frequently the
most widely read and highly cited articles in both the journal and in general. This is because, when done
effectively, they offer a current overview of the state of knowledge on a subject and may or may not include a
statistical analysis of the data [18]. Instead of serving as a foundation for an individual researcher's work, it
creates a strong starting point for anyone in the community who is interested in a particular field or topic [19].
The extent and thoroughness of the literature review showcase the author's expertise and scholarly proficiency in

their field of study. These reviews also provide a solid foundation for the investigation of a paper or study.

frame to appropriately evaluate the origin and reliability of the research topic being examined, which had
previously been examined by several other researchers. The related studies in the research focus on the impact
of alcohol consumption on students' academic achievement.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section contains a summary of the works of literature examined in this study, which focus on the
effects of alcohol consumption on student academic performance. The objective, the summary of the results, and
the findings that are interpreted for future recommendations are all included in the overview.
1. Objectives of the Study
The objectives used in the table above represent how it is like this study. The specific objective
describes will be investigated during the study, whereas e general goal is a comprehensive statement about the
overall aim of the study. The objectives that are mentioned above are (1) Investigating outcomes that may affect
academic achievement regarding alcohol intake of academic schoolers, and (2) Determining the level of alcohol
use and awareness of its harmful impacts on student health.

& Moodley, 2012)
Outcomes in the first objective that is shown in the table above are that alcohol consumption is having
a detrimental effect on some students and families, leading to a potential increase in dropouts and poor academic
performance [20]. It is very important to examine the level of alcohol consumption or intake and to understand
its harmful effects on human health as mentioned in Table 1. The consumption of alcohol harms human health
throughout one's life. Previous studies have linked alcohol consumption to numerous diseases including cancer,
pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, cancers, psychiatric
conditions, and injury [21]. The negative effects of drinking alcohol during childhood and adolescence far
outweigh the few positive impacts. It's likely that postponing the start of alcohol consumption and reducing the
amount consumed by young individuals will improve their health and overall well-being (Birch, et al., 2009).
These objectives explore areas that affect the factor of alcoholism.
2. Findings of the Related Studies
This section examines the findings/results of related studies that are indicated in Table 2. above. These
findings investigated alcohol consumption and whether it is affecting the learner’s academic performance. These
studies analyzed the relationships between binge drinking of alcohol and the results of their studies indicating
that consuming large amounts of alcohol can lead to missing classes, poor concentration, decreased motivation,
and difficulty with memory and learning. It also led to poor decision-making, which result in poor academic
performance or even expulsion.

(Balsa, Gandelman, & We use an average of test results to proxy cognitive abilities, and we use a measure
Roldán, 2018) of the frequency of alcohol dependence in the previous 30 days to proxy risky
behavior. Our data come from a sample of ten private high schools' 9th and 10th-
grade students.
(Sung, So, & Jeong, We discovered a negative association between alcohol consumption and academic
2016) achievement in adolescents, even after controlling for covariates.
(Ukwayi, Lucy, Chibuzo, According to the findings of this study, the majority of respondents are between the
& Undelikwo, 2013) ages of 15 and 35, which is the age of unhealthy behaviors characterized by
substance use and abuse.
(Onyebuchukwu, The findings revealed a significant relationship between academic performance, a
Sholarin, & Chico, 2015) significant difference in academic performance between students who drink alcohol
and those who do not, and a significant effect of consumption on academic
performance.
(Meda, et al., 2017) On the whole, our findings add to the growing body of teenage years use literature by
demonstrating that the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana can jeopardize
college GPA.
(Meier, Hill, Small, & Even after controlling for 9th-grade GPA and externalizing symptoms, adolescents
Luthar, 2015) from an upper-middle-class institution who used cannabis had lower GPAs and more
projecting symptoms in 12th grade.
(Tembo, Burns, & A sizable proportion of participants (44%) reported drinking at dangerous or harmful
Kalembo, 2017) levels. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that students who consumed
dangerous amounts of alcohol were 1.2 times more likely to report psychological
distress than those who consumed less alcohol.
(Ansari, Salam, & Gender was associated with all alcohol behaviors after controlling for a living
Suominen, 2020) situation, marital status, age (all of which were associated with two behaviors),
parental education, and year of study (each associated with one behavior).
(Welwel, et al., 2022) Most students have been involved in accidents and injuries as a result of their
alcoholism, making them ill and unable to attend lectures.
(Evans-Whipp, Plenty, Six students were no longer in school at the time the Grade 9 survey was
Catalano, Herrenkohl, & administered, so they were excluded from the analysis. 44 students were removed
Toumbourou, 2013) from the sample based on honesty criteria.
(Patte, Qian, & Between students who had never binge drunk before, those who reported regular
Leatherdale, 2017) binge drinking at follow-up were less likely to complete their homework, attend
class, value, and achieve high grades, with more frequent binge drinking at follow-up
resulting in larger relative risk ratios.
(Andacao & Lad, 2021) The findings revealed that the student's overall level of alcohol consumption was
moderate, while their academic performance score was determined to be satisfactory.
Each of the outcomes defined a significant difference in college students' alcohol
consumption.
The studies by Balsa et al. [8], Bolin et al. [22], Meda et al. [23], and Meier et al. )[24] show that the
GPA of students is greatly affected by alcohol intake. It's important to comprehend the connection between
teenage alcohol consumption and high school grades, given the widespread use of alcohol among this age group
and recent research on adolescent brain development, which suggests that excessive alcohol use during this
period can have negative impacts on brain development[25[, [26]. On the other hand, studies of Ansari et al. [6],
Sung et al. [9], Onyebuchukwu et al. [11], Tembo et al. 27], Welwel et al. [28], and Patte et al. [29] found that
alcohol consumption has adverse negative adverse effects on the student’s academic performance. Those who
frequently engage in binge drinking are more likely to miss classes and fall behind in their studies [30]. Previous
research has also shown that alcohol consumption not only poses a threat to one's health but also leads to
significant social harm such as alcoholism and traffic accidents [31]. Additionally, based on these studies,
alcohol abuse can lead to health problems, which can further negatively impact academic performance. The
research examines multiple potential reasons for alcohol's negative impact on academic performance. Along
with examining mediators connected to educational attendance, it looks into how drinking affects a student's
ability to concentrate and stick to their academic goals [8].
3. Recommendations of Related Studies
Table 3 showed the recommendations of related studies that came from their results and findings.
Therefore, the frequent consumption of alcohol during adolescence can be viewed as a potential risk factor or

warning sign of future health and social issues.
Table 3. Recommendations of Related Studies
Author (s) Recommendations
(Balsa, Giuliano, & French, 2011) The results suggest that alcohol consumption has a slightly
detrimental impact on the grade point average of male students and
that this effect is notably influenced by elevated school absenteeism
and difficulties with academic responsibilities.
(Ansari, Stock, & Mills, 2013) Future studies should incorporate well-designed methodologies and
both objective and subjective evaluations of academic performance.
(Bolin, Pate, & McClintock, 2017) The findings suggest that prevention efforts provide a focus on
marijuana use concerning alcohol use.
(Balsa, Gandelman, & Roldán, 2018) The outcomes of this research may help explain the reasons behind
the lack of parental involvement in areas with low human capital
development.
(Sung, So, & Jeong, 2016) We suggest implementing interventions to decrease alcohol
consumption among teenagers as a means of enhancing academic
success.
(Ukwayi, Lucy, Chibuzo, & The result recommends daily consultation to reduce damaging
Undelikwo, 2013) results and improve students' academic success, as well as
consulting students to drink alcohol in moderation.
(Onyebuchukwu, Sholarin, & Chico, • A sustained educational program on the impact of alcohol use on
2015) academic achievement will be implemented for students.
• Alcohol companies' promotional sales will be prohibited.
• Prohibiting drinking establishments and bars from operating
within or near school grounds.
• Self-training will be conducted regularly to ensure that students
should understand that it is not a self-esteem booster.
• To deter others, universities will conduct alcohol level screenings
regularly.
(Ansari, Salam, & Suominen, 2020) Universities should evaluate students' problematic drinking and
alcohol use disorders to facilitate more efficient and effective
interventions.
(Welwel, et al., 2022) 1. Universities should develop techniques and strategies to educate
students who have not previously been addicted. Counseling should
be used to help students overcome their alcoholism.
2. There must be strategies, methods, and techniques in place to
assist all addicted students in overcoming their alcohol dependency.
Guidance and counseling treatment programs for those who have
become addicted, so that they can begin to control their drinking or
become alcohol dependent.
(Evans-Whipp, Plenty, Catalano, It suggests that reducing harm messages and advising approaches
Herrenkohl, & Toumbourou, 2013) may also lower damaging drinking habits, as suggested by harm
reduction advocates.
(Patte, Qian, & Leatherdale, 2017) According to the findings, students who begin drinking, have low
academic motivation. and effectiveness, which could also obstruct
their future academic aspirations.
(Andacao & Lad, 2021) Each school organization should implement a functional and
sustainable moral recovery program that includes threat assessment,
substance abuse, and alcohol education.
This highlights the importance of making a concerted effort to find effective prevention and
intervention strategies to address this issue [32]. Studies by Sung et al. [9], Ukwayi et al. [33], Onyebuchukwu
et al. [11], Welwel et al. (2022) and Andacao and Lad [34] suggested that providing consultation and recovery
programs for students for them to do better on their academic performances that affected by alcohol drinking.
Investigating the impact of alcohol consumption on the academic performance of college students will result in
proposals for reducing alcohol consumption among [35] student drinkers. The table above that contains different
recommendations from other studies that are related to this study implying that drinking alcohol has a greater

impact mainly on the health of people and the academic performance of learners. These results align more with
the notion that peers influence individuals' preferences rather than limiting their options [36]. These studies also
suggest that it affects and increased academic absence, and the probability of difficulty at school. These results
lay the foundation for a future research project that aims to determine if certain factors, such as support from a
healthy parent, self-control abilities, and other individual assets, can distinguish between a compensating and
decompensating response [37]. Prevention strategies are also mentioned in the recommendations above to
control drinking that harms learners’ health and performance. These recommendations help other ongoing
studies to set measures that can be taken. By providing specific and feasible suggestions, these
recommendations can facilitate the practical application of findings and promote positive change.
The extent of excessive drinking among students, as well as their comprehension of its effects on their bodies, is
a major public health concern around the world. It can lead to poor academic performance, absenteeism, and a
greater risk of dropping out. It may also cause physical and mental health issues, as well as social and
relationship problems. It is critical for educators and school administrators to recognize the signs of alcoholism
and to provide resources and support to students who are suffering from the disease. Furthermore, students
should be educated about the risks and dangers of alcohol abuse, as well as the resources available to them if
they or someone they know is struggling with alcoholism. For example, the results show that alcohol
consumption on workdays affects students' final grades, whereas alcohol consumption on weekends has no
effect [3]. According to the findings of the Balsa et al. [38] study, the primary assessment of academic
achievement is the student’s GPA which is extracted from official school transcripts. Increasing alcohol intake,
in contrast, is linked to self-reported academic stress in females. According to Sholarin et al. [39], universities
are no longer governed by their parents and are free to pursue their interests. This is evident as some
undergraduates go insane during their academic journey and some individuals experience memory impairment,
hindering their ability to graduate due to consistently poor academic performance [40].
IV. CONCLUSION
To conclude, alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on academic performance by impairing
cognitive function, increasing absenteeism, and decreasing motivation and focus. Long-term binge drinking can
also result in more serious consequences, such as academic expulsion and a lower chance of graduating. And
ensure optimal academic performance, it is generally advised to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while in
school.
As a result of these findings, it is generally recommended that alcohol consumption be limited or avoided to
maintain academic performance. Alcohol can impair cognitive function, memory, and concentration, all of
which are necessary for academic success. Excessive alcohol consumption can also lead to poor decision-
making, which can lead to academic and personal problems. It's also worth noting that excessive alcohol
consumption can lead to addiction and serious health problems. As a result, it is best to limit or avoid alcohol
consumption while at school.

two studies used data from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Survey—Birth Cohort,27,46 two studies used data from the National Health Interview Survey,31,40
two studies used data from the Listening to Mothers III
survey,41,43 and three studies used data from the Wisconsin
Maternity Leave and Health Project.28,39,42 Parental leave was defined as job-protected time off
work after childbirth (table 2), which includes parental
(family), maternity, and paternity leave. Parental leave is
typically gender neutral and available to both parents, whereas maternity leave is for mothers and paternity leave for fathers. Nonetheless, studies often refer to
maternity or paternity leave despite the fact that some
countries included in the studies have a gender-neutral
policy (eg, Sweden and the USA).
With regard to outcomes, depressive symptoms
established via validated scales or self-reported data, depression, or hospital admission for depression were examined in 27 studies.18,21,25–30,32–34,39,41–43,46,49–52,54–60 Other mental health outcomes included psychological distress,31,40,44,60 stress,17,20,24,25,41,45,51,61 burnout,24,32,58,59 anxiety,33,39,42,50 general mental health,21,29,35,36,48,53 use of mental health care,41 inpatient and outpatient hospital admissions for mental and behavioural disorders,20,37 antidepressant use,20 suicide,47 and various self-reported symptoms of mental health.21,22 Most studies17,19–23,25–46,48–61
examined the association between parental leave and
mental health during the post-partum period, generally up to 3 years post partum. One study investigated the risk of paternal suicide 3–20 years after childbirth47 and
two studies explored mental health outcomes in older women (aged >40 years).18,23 No study assessed whether schemes introducing
parental leave in general, relative to no parental leave,
influenced maternal mental health, and no study
compared maternal uptake of any parental leave with no
parental leave.
Compared with unpaid leave schemes, the introduction
of paid parental leave schemes was generally associated
with improved maternal mental health in the post-
partum period.21,22,31,36,40,44 In Australia, quasi-experimental
studies found improved general mental health36 and
reduced depression risks21 among mothers eligible for
both paid and unpaid leave compared with mothers only
eligible for unpaid leave. After the establishment of paid
leave in California22,31,40,44 and New Jersey,40 USA-based
quasi-experimental studies noted reduced risks of
psychological distress31,40,44 and improved mental health22
among resident mothers compared with mothers living
in states that did not provide paid leave or that were
under pre-reform conditions, thus providing only federal
unpaid leave.
Observational evidence of an association between
mothers’ parental leave benefits and maternal mental
health outcomes showed mixed findings. In the USA,
one study showed that, among women being on leave for
a similar duration, women who received paid leave had

lower risks of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder than women receiving unpaid leave.46 By contrast, other USA-based studies found no difference in
depressive symptoms,38,41 although one study reported lower risk of mental-health-care use in mothers who
received paid leave than in mothers who received no or unpaid leave.41 A German study found no difference in
post-partum mental health between women who received
earnings-based benefits and women who received a
lower basic flat-rate benefit.53 Schemes lengthening parental leave generally appeared to be favourable for maternal post-partum
mental health in quasi-experimental studies.17,19,20,26,27,29,61
Three USA-based studies examining both unpaid and
paid leave extensions up to 6 months post partum
showed decreases in depressive symptoms among
mothers with longer leave uptake, with less conclusive
findings for extensions of paid leave alone.26,27,29 Another
USA-based study with less reliable instruments
(eg, infant health and child-care arrangements) found
improved mental health among women with extended paid and unpaid leave.48 Other studies found that paid
leave extensions led to decreased risks of stress among
mothers in Chile17 and Japan61 and reduced rates of
inpatient and outpatient hospital admissions for mental
and behavioural disorders in mothers living in
Denmark.20 Conversely, a Canadian study, which was
given a weak risk of bias score, showed no changes in
maternal depression risks before and after the extension
of paid leave.19
Observational evidence from the USA suggested that
mothers’ longer uptake of parental leave was associated
with reduced risks of depressive symptoms.
11 of 18 studies found that length of unpaid, paid, or
combined leave was associated with some decrease in
depressive symptoms,26,27,32,33,41,43,47,51,54,57,58 whereas seven
studies found no change.28,29,34,39,42,50,59 Protective lengths

OREWORD
A lcohol and its relationship to ill health have been recognized as an important public
health challenge even though alcohol use has been part of the cultural traditions in
different societies. In India, the earliest public health oriented report on alcohol can be traced
to a chapter in the Bhore Committee Report of 1946, which showed great foresight by separating
out two groups of people who might have been subjected to the ill effects of alcohol: (i) those
driven to drinking by misery, poor living conditions and lack of educational and of recreational
facilities and (ii) those that may result by the excesses of folk customs and group habits. The
Committee suggestions included a rise in the standard of living accompanied by the provision
of education and recreation facility, balanced by health education to bring home to the people
the harmful effects of convivial drinking.
The NIMHANS team led by Dr. Gururaj have brought together a significant, evidence-based
pre-policy document, probably the most comprehensive one after the chapter in the Bhore
Committee Report. The evidence they have gathered is particularly strong on the biomedical,
legal, social, and economic determinants of the problem with some mention of the cultural
determinants and the complex political economy of the problem.
While bringing together a wide body of evidence from a range of sources, they have quite
rightly emphasized the paucity of good data and evidence-based, policy-oriented research,
making an emphatic demand for more policy research as well as its translation into policy.
The division of the document into sections such as introduction, objectives and methodologies
of the review, production type and sales of alcoholic beverages, prevalence and pattern of
alcohol consumption, biological influences and health consequences, social implications,
responses to the problem, key policy issues, and conclusion and recommendations, makes this
document a very comprehensive one. It particularly emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature
of the problem and the multisectoral nature of the response required to meet this challenge.
The document very effectively underlines the 'public health framework' within which this policy
should evolve so that it supports the 'Health for All' commitment of the government and its
efforts towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The challenge will be to ensure
i"
"Gururaj_-Alcohol-report-NIMHANS.pdf,page:13","that the market and trade policies and other vested interests do not distort the efforts towards
a rational policy. As the authors have rightly emphasized, only 'scientific evidence' and a 'public
health focus' can be a bulwark against such policy distortions.
Almost sixty years ago, the Bhore committee had showed great prophetic oversight by suggesting
that ""little economic merit can be claimed for a system of taxation which raises any
considerable part of the public revenue from the sale of alcohol, unless, as a part of the
plan of government, this tax money is used to reduce the extent of facilities for the sale
of alcoholic beverages; to promote the observance of restrictive laws; to meet the cost
of prevention, care and treatment of alcoholism among the considerable number of
persons whose health will be injured and whose earning capacity will be reduced by the
use of alcohol"". The Bhore committee suggested a plan of action that included: instructions
in schools on the effects of alcohol and narcotics; strict control of existing liquor shops;
treatment facilities for acute and chronic alcoholism; health promotion; legal sanction for
detention of those who need segregation and treatment; active role for NGO's and voluntary
effort; and restriction of alcohol consumption during working hours.
This comprehensive report from NIMHANS makes a similar case for a multidimensional response
to the problem in today's context backed by substantial evidence. It is sincerely hoped that this
report will be a major instrument of advocacy and policy development.

OREWORD
A lcohol has now become a common word in the Indian society. With the impact of
globalization, urbanization, industrialization, media influence and changing life
styles, alcohol has entered into the lives of Indians in a big and unrestricted manner. From
times when alcohol sale was restricted to a few bars and pubs, today, alcohol is available in
plenty and in several local outlets, and is within the easy reach of today's young generation.
As always, when any product is not adequately controlled and regulated, its ill effects begin to
take an upper hand resulting in a huge negative impact on people's health. The response to
this epidemic and to the host of deleterious consequences has been rather slow and without
direction.
Research in the past few years has conclusively demonstrated that nearly one in 3 male adults
consume alcohol, and 5% of Indian women are already regular users. Interestingly, the age of
initiation of drinking is progressively coming down. Majority of young Indians after
experimenting with alcohol for pleasure seeking and peer influence, end up as habitual users.
A significant amount of the public health burden comes from intoxicated behavior, resulting
in accidents, violence and other Behavioral consequences. With Indian patterns of drinking
being different from the west and more than 500 million adults using a variety of licit and
illicit liquor, the negative impact for the country is huge.
Over years, our attempts to address the growing problem has been limited, fragmented and
piecemeal. While revenue departments have worked relentlessly on filling coffers, health
professionals are preoccupied in providing care for the ever-increasing number of alcohol
users; police are battling to curb the menace of alcohol on roads, at home and in work places,
NGOs are busy in increasing awareness; social welfare officials are waging a losing battle to
rehabilitate alcohol addicts and courts are regularly hearing cases of alcohol impact and
awarding compensations and verdicts. Ironically, health professionals and media colleagues
have only fuelled this debate with confusing messages regarding alcohol use. What is apparent
amidst the controversies of how much of alcohol use is right or wrong, is the absence of a
unified vision, a public health approach and the common goal of a healthy society.
iii"
"Gururaj_-Alcohol-report-NIMHANS.pdf,page:15","It is true that alcohol use is a problem in every country. One look around the globe, especially
the High Income Countries (HIC), reveals that the impact of alcohol use is on the downslide:
seen as decreased production, reduced consumption and increased efforts to minimizing harm
from alcohol use. Integrated and coordinated policies, sustainable action plans, public health
perspective vis-à-vis revenue perspective of alcohol, a better informed society, and strict
governmental control of alcohol have paved the way for emergence of societies with less
harmful effects of alcohol. The Indian experience of prohibition, education, timings of sale,
sales to minors, drink drive laws and others have all remained on paper, with no tangible
effects seen on the ground.
It is time the Indian society wakes up to this epidemic, before many more lives are destroyed and
families wiped out. The need of the hour is to have a public health approach with sustainable
policies and comprehensive programs which are based on evidence and research and on an
intersectoral platform. The Indian Government and the Ministry of Health are in the process of
formulating a rational alcohol control policy. To facilitate this process and foster a scientific
decision making process, NIMHANS has brought together all available evidence from India and
lessons from around the globe, highlighted issues of concern and provided an overview of the
past efforts in this area. We need to now address alcohol problems through a variety of measures
including strict control measures as well as reduction of demand and early intervention. I hope
this effort of NIMHANS team will help, support and facilitate the national effort towards making
our present and future generations safe and healthy.

REFACE
A lthough alcohol use existed in India for a long time, of late, it has invaded life in
India in a big way. Nearly 30% of Indian men and 5% of Indian women are regular
users of alcohol. Recent trends include easy availability of alcohol, massive direct and indirect
advertisement of alcohol, increasing number of alcohol sales outlets in both urban and rural
areas, earlier age of starting drinking and greater extent of drinking amongst women.
Consequent to these changes, the use of alcohol has increased. As a fall out, the harmful
hazardous effects of alcohol have also increased.
Ethanol in alcohol is a chemical and after consumption has a multitude of effects. These
effects influence physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and financial spheres of an individual,
family and the society. Alcohol is linked to more than 60 health conditions and a variety of
harmful effects ranging from brawls and accidents on road to its effects on poverty and
indebtedness in society. Due to lack of scientific research in India on the effects of alcohol, the
harmful and hazardous effects are still not documented clearly.
Globally, it is well acknowledged that both short and long-term impact of alcohol need to be
understood and addressed for a healthy society. Individuals and families incur huge amounts
of out of pocket expenditure for managing acute and chronic effects of alcohol, while
governments spend enormous resources on hospitals, courts, police stations, rehabilitation
centers and others to help families manage alcohol related problems. For the state governments,
alcohol has been a major revenue earner. Apart from competing economic interests, individual
freedom and media promotion, there has been a growing debate and an evolving consensus
that alcohol control and reducing its harmful effects need to be addressed on a priority in
Indian society. Recently, the Government of India and the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare (MOHFW) have expressed concern and initiated dialogue to develop relevant activities.
To facilitate this process of policy dialogue, we undertook the challenge of compiling available
information from the Indian region and, global as well as local experiences in addressing the
problem. In the accompanying report, we have examined alcohol availability, prevalence and
patterns of use, health, psychological, social and economic impact of alcohol and various
v"
"Gururaj_-Alcohol-report-NIMHANS.pdf,page:17","initiatives to address the problem. Measures undertaken by health and other ministries have
also been analyzed for their impact. The report strongly emphasizes the inadequate efforts
and the systemic failures in addressing the problem.
There is a need to develop comprehensive, integrated and people-centered alcohol control
policies and programs. This requires moving beyond the immediate focus of economic returns
to the government and industry towards committing for a healthy and a safe society. Developing
a society that cares for its citizens, particularly children and adolescents requires a strong
political commitment for setting up mechanisms to curb the growing menace of alcohol use.
Given the recent commitments of the Government of India for a people centered healthy society,
we feel that the time is appropriate to address the problem to seek positive solutions. Our
efforts will be worthwhile, if policy makers, professionals, public, media and other opinion
makers in the civil society make a determined effort to nurture a society that is free from the
harmful and hazardous effects of alcohol.

The changing face of India
India, located in South Asia is the 7th largest country and the 14th largest geography. It is the second most populous
country (1.2 billion people in 2010). Administratively, India is divided into 28 states and 7 Union territories which
are further subdivided into 626 districts. India’s economy is the 5th largest economy in the world (GDP purchasing
power parity in 2008 was estimated to be USD 3.3 trillion) with a GDP growth rate of 8.8% during 2010.
The declining death rates (12.5 / 1000 population in 1981, 8.4 /1000 in 2001 and 6.3 / 1000 in 2008), birth rates
(34 /1000 in 1981, 25 /1000 in 2001 and 22/1000 in 2008) and increases in expectation of life at birth (64 years
in 2001) signify India’s growth and development. The average life expectancy for a female newborn in the new
millennium is an impressive 66 years. The pace and face of urbanization with their far reaching consequences are
making quick inroads even to smaller towns. The vigorous media expansion and speedy penetration of technology
is bringing in changes to the traditional lifestyles.
‘Incredible India’ is in the midst of transition with extreme polarities coexisting in day to day lives of people. The
largest 63-year-old, democracy in the world is witnessing transition of all types: demographic (from a predominantly
child population to a predominantly adult population with an increasing elderly population), social (from earlier
joint families to increasing number of nuclear families), epidemiological (from scabies to suicides – with rising non-
communicable diseases and injuries along with the continued burden of communicable diseases) and economic
(rising income levels with decreasing poverty ratios where slums coexist next to pent houses).
The young have survived the earlier childhood killer diseases but are today more prone to behavior and life-style
disorders. Coupled with sedentary life-style, increasing use of tobacco and greater stress are contributing
significantly to the triple burden of diseases. The mortality, morbidity and resultant disability due to non-
communicable diseases and injuries continue to increase and currently contribute to nearly three fourths of the
total disease burden. The investment in health for building public health systems and developing the required
work force are not commensurate to manage the new and emerging threats and challenges. The sum total of
changes outside the health sector has made an effect on the health of people It is continuing to make an impact
on the health of the population. Alcohol is definitely in this list of contributing factors.

The real challenge for winemakers in India is to develop a domestic market. Consumption of wine when we compare
it with the other alcoholic beverages, is very small. The younger segments are not drinking nearly as much wine
- those aged 18-24 represent only 6% of wine consumed. They are spoilt for choice - a proliferation in alternative
purchase decision. There has been an explosion in the RTD (Ready to Drink) market especially Breezers and the
options available for many varied markets. . . .the young customers are very focused on 'brand' - they are 'brand'
savvy. They are open to brand promises, indeed look for brands as a way of making the choices they make all the
time. Focusing on brand strengthening within these key markets of tomorrow will be vital. While it is likely that
young people of today will gradually grow their wine consumption, it is by no means assured. Ensuring that a
smooth transition into wine consumption is possible will involve making wine easily accessible to the average
alcohol consumer, who may generally find making alternative selections such as beer or RTDs easier.

Per capita consumption figures: what do they mean
Population based alcohol surveys are an important method of collecting per capita alcohol consumption data
which are also specific to socio-demographic groups within populations. They can be used to gather data on
drinking patterns, quantity intake and also document acute adverse consequences. But cost and time constraints
preclude such a frequently exercise. Routinely, per capita estimates are derived from alcohol sales or production
and from import and export data which are usually collected for taxation purposes. This obviously represents the
total amount of taxable alcohol available within a country or region. They do not include home-made and illicit
commercial alcohol, duty free and smuggled alcohol and consumption on travel when not in their region or
country. The per capita numbers in international databases are obtained by dividing taxable alcohol volumes by
population of that region or country. It is expressed as the average volume of alcohol consumed for all individuals
aged 15 years and older. In the context of temperant cultures like India, such a method of calculation is bound to
yield erroneously lower estimates of individual consumption.
Population-based alcohol survey estimates of consumption and that of taxable alcohol available for consumption are
sometimes compared. However, there are discrepancies between these two measures. Majority of population
based alcohol surveys substantially under-estimate taxable alcohol available for consumption. This is attributed to
under-reporting of consumption by survey respondents. However, where a high level of untaxed alcohol is consumed,
it is possible for surveys to produce estimates higher than those derived from estimates of taxable alcohol availability.
Benegal et al (2003) collected alcohol consumption data from a large representative sample from the state of
Karnataka in South India. Projecting the total beverage alcohol consumed by the sample population to the presumed
5.11 million consumers in the state yielded an estimated annual consumption of 101 million liters absolute alcohol
equivalent (Excise paid beverage (57 million liters) + Undocumented beverage - 44 million liters). This amounted to
a surprisingly high per capita consumption of 3 liters absolute alcohol equivalent per adult person per year.

Measures of alcohol consumption
Alcohol dependence
A pattern of alcohol use characterized by:
♦ compulsion to use
♦ loss of control (of use, onset, termination or level of use)
♦ withdrawal symptoms on reduction or cessation
♦ tolerance
♦ neglect of alternative pleasures or interests
♦ persistent use despite the knowledge of physical or psychological harm
Withdrawal state (with and without delirium)
A group of symptoms of variable clustering and severity occurring on absolute or relative withdrawal of a
psychoactive substance after persistent use of that substance. The onset and course of the withdrawal state
are time-limited and are related to the type of psychoactive substance and dose being used immediately before
cessation or reduction of use. The withdrawal state may be complicated by convulsions.
Harmful use
A pattern of psychoactive substance use that is causing damage to health. The damage may be physical (as in cases
of hepatitis from the self-administration of injected psychoactive substances) or mental (e.g. episodes of depressive
disorder secondary to heavy consumption of alcohol).
Source: WHO, 1994
Hazardous use
Hazardous use is a pattern of alcohol consumption carrying with it a risk of harmful consequences to the drinker. This
damage may be to health (physical or mental) or may include social consequences to the drinker or others. In
assessing the extent of that risk, the pattern of use, as well as other factors such as family history, should be taken
into account.

Excerpts from the draft alcohol taxation policy
3. Some general observations:- In the aforesaid ideological, socio-economic and reality back-drop and analysis
in the subsequent chapters, the following general observations are made:
i. Prohibition is not a viable policy.
ii. Though the play of market forces in a free trade regime leads to optimization of resources, this may not
be the best recipe for alcoholic products because of its very negative nature. Moreover, after reaching
saturation level in consumption in the developed countries, there is a very real danger of surplus
production in these countries being ""marketed"" and dumped into developing countries. The Union and
the State Governments should, therefore, take necessary measures to protect citizens from this
phenomenon.
iii. Scientific studies have proved the efficacy of the physical controls in controlling consumption, in spite
of their known negative side effects (illicit distillation, trafficking etc). Further, to minimize such side
effects, control regime should be reasonable and transparent and give least discretion to the operators.
iv. The tax element in the price structure will have to be high so long as the cost price of liquor continues
to be low. In the long run, with the increase in the cost price, due to increased demand of alcohol for
industrial and fuel use, the element of taxes can be brought down.
v. A model excise policy should ensure that the objectives of minimization of consumption and maximization
of revenue are achieved without putting unreasonable restrictions on the individual's freedom of choice
and unreasonably high taxation.
vi. Raising rates beyond the threshold, instead of generating higher revenue and discouraging consumption,
would lead to evasion of taxes, smuggling and illicit distillation. Therefore, efforts should be to rationalize
tax and policy regimes so as-to plug leakages and realize full revenue due to the State for legitimate and
responsible drinking.

Community campaign to reduce alcohol use
Within months a mass movement against alcoholism emerged in the district. Young people and women formed
groups in their villages and passed resolutions to ban liquor, and marches were organized. Area-level conferences
against liquor were held in four places. In November 1988 a district level conference against alcohol was organized;
3000 delegates, half of them women, came from 150 villages……(in this conference) men and women described
alcohol-related suffering and how they tried to counter it by collective action. Women who had persuaded their
addicted husbands to relinquish alcohol were publicly congratulated….. (also)…people described how certain
police officers gave protection to liquor vendors and harassed members of the community who opposed illicit
liquor. The police chief (who was an invitee) noted this and subsequently penalized the offending constables.
A district Darumukti Sangatana (Organization for liberation from liquor) was formed and more resolutions were
passed. A ban on the illicit sale and consumption of alcohol was put into effect in 200 villages. Women in one village
locked up drunk men overnight and publicly disgraced them the next morning. A delegation visited a village where
the ban was being defied, and warned the villagers that a boycott would be imposed in the absence of compliance;
a day later the village fell in to line…… The illicit liquor trade was thus stopped, but the sale of liquor in shops
licensed by the government continued. These shops were invariably owned by local politicians and enjoyed official
patronage. The state obtained substantial tax revenues from the sale of liquor and said that this was necessary
for welfare programs. The people ridiculed this, saying that they would take better care of themselves if they
retained more of their money, and that the government had no right to sell addiction….The three members of the
state Legislative Assembly in the district jointly submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister demanding the
closure of licensed liquor shops and the transfer of authority over the use of alcohol to the village communities.
The people no longer wished to depend solely on the administration for the control of alcoholism……Although not
completely abolished, alcohol consumption has been drastically reduced in about 200 villages.
Women and young people have gained confidence through collective action. A monthly wall poster magazine has
sprung up which publishes news, views and experiences on health and alcoholism. A gathering of 6000 small
farmers took an oath to abstain from alcohol. The attention of the public and the government has focused on
alcoholism as a public health problem and on state policy which aggravates the situation.Bang and Bang, 1991

BOX 22
World Trade Organization, Globalization and Liberalization
World Trade Organization was created in 1994 to encourage free trade amongst the 142 member countries. From
the perspective of free trade, alcohol is seen primarily as a commercial 'good' to be traded freely internationally
like any other commodity, or as a 'service' or an 'investment' with the right to establish anywhere. Public health
experts have expressed great concern about the risks such agreements pose to alcohol control initiatives.
Various countries have used a wide variety of strategies seeking to minimize the harm caused by the use of
alcohol. These include regulating alcohol availability and access by maintaining state monopolies on production,
distribution and sale of alcohol; maintaining high taxes on alcohol, public education campaigns or restriction on
advertising. Many of these measures will be eliminated with the new rules imposed by the World Trade Organization.
Amongst the key elements in international agreements of the World Trade Organization, important aspects
relevant to alcohol control policy include:
(cid:2) equal treatment to foreign and domestic liquors
(cid:2) removal of state monopoly on manufacture, distribution and retailing alcohol
(cid:2) reduction or elimination of quotas on quantity of liquor which can be imported.
The protection of human health is a recognized legitimate objective under treaties of the World Trade Organization.
However, to invoke this exception, a government must demonstrate that the measure is necessary to protect
the health of the population and that no other alternative but barriers to free trade are needed. Appealing panels
of the World Trade Organization have interpreted this exception very restrictively. Only one regulatory measure
(the French Government's ban on asbestos) has ever been upheld by the panel.
As long as negotiations over alcohol policy are dominated by the vested interests of free trade and industry-
under the spurious banner of personal choice-governments …. will continue to shirk their moral obligations
to protect their populations from the preventable risk of alcohol-related harm.

Draft global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol
25th March 2010 (A63/13)
The draft Global Strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol was adopted on 21st May 2010 at the World Health
Assembly. The Global strategy identifies a number of challenges which include need for increasing global action
and greater international cooperation to decrease the impact of alcohol use, while balancing economic and public
health interests. The guiding principle is that public health interest must generate interventions to reduce the
harmful use of alcohol and policies must encompass all alcoholic beverages and target users and their peers and
simultaneously support those who abstain. The global strategy aims to give guidance for action at all levels, set
priority areas for global action and recommend a portfolio of policy options and measures with emphasis on
vulnerable groups such as adolescents and people with low socio-economic status.
Objectives:
(a) To raise global awareness of the magnitude and nature of the health, social and economic problems caused
by harmful use of alcohol, and increased commitment by governments to act to address the harmful use of
alcohol
(b) To strengthen knowledge base on the magnitude and determinants of alcohol-related harm and on effective
interventions to reduce and prevent such harm
(c) To increase technical support to, and enhanced capacity of, Member States for preventing the harmful use
of alcohol and managing alcohol-use disorders and associated health conditions;
(d) To strengthen partnerships and better coordination among stakeholders and increased mobilization of
resources required for appropriate and concerted action to prevent the harmful use of alcohol
(e) To improve systems for monitoring and surveillance at different levels, and more effective dissemination and
application of information for advocacy, policy development and evaluation purposes
Guiding principles:
The protection of the health of the population by preventing and reducing the harmful use of alcohol is a public
health priority. The following principles will guide the development and implementation of policies at all levels; they
reflect the multifaceted determinants of alcohol-related harm and the concerted multisectoral actions required
to implement effective interventions.
(a) Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated
by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence.
(b) Policies should be equitable and sensitive to national, religious and cultural contexts.
(c) All involved parties have the responsibility to act in ways that do not undermine the implementation of public
policies and interventions to prevent and reduce harmful use of alcohol.
Contd....
94"
"Gururaj_-Alcohol-report-NIMHANS.pdf,page:122","(d) Public health should be given proper deference in relation to competing interests and approaches that
support that direction should be promoted.
(e) Protection of populations at high risk of alcohol-attributable harm and those exposed to the effects of
harmful drinking by others should be an integral part of policies addressing the harmful use of alcohol.
(f) Individuals and families affected by the harmful use of alcohol should have access to affordable and effective
prevention and care services.
(g) Children, teenagers and adults who choose not to drink alcohol beverages have the right to be supported in
their non-drinking behavior and protected from pressures to drink.
(h) Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should encompass all alcoholic
beverages and surrogate alcohol.1
The 10 areas for National policies and measures are
1) Leadership, awareness and commitment
2) Health services' response
3) Community action
4) Drink-driving policies and countermeasures
5) Availability of alcohol
6) Marketing of alcoholic beverages
7) Pricing policies
8) Reducing the negative consequences of drinking and alcohol intoxication
9) Reducing the public health impact of illicit alcohol and informally produced alcohol
10) Monitoring and surveillance.

Role of Governments in alcohol control
That the government has a greater role in deciding the production, sale, marketing and thereby consumption of
alcohol across the country is undisputable. The flip-flop policies of the various state governments in bringing
about either partial or total prohibition in the face of resource crunch are a sufficient indicator for the need to
consider/implement alternate sustainable measures. While beverage alcohol cannot be considered a public good,
it needs to be simultaneously noted that alcohol use as a habit or behavior cannot be wished away. This increases
the responsibility of the governments to look at managing alcohol related harm in a comprehensive and holistic
manner. Currently the driving agenda for an alcohol policy in the country seems to be the revenues and
international pressure in the wake of globalisation. The domestic alcohol industry concerns have been considered
uppermost as against the public health concerns. Notwithstanding idealism the need of the hour is to be pragmatic.
The government has to take a more detailed and health conscious perspective to manage problems from alcohol
consumption. There is a need to expand prevention efforts to include reducing harm from alcohol across all
sections of the society. Some guiding principles in this regard are that:
a) Alcohol should not be considered as a freely tradable commodity as there is an enormous health, social and
economic consequences.
b) Long term perspectives needs to be drawn up as against short term directives or knee jerk reactions.
c) The public health concern which includes the larger health and social consequences of alcohol use should be
the driver for an integrated alcohol policy for the country.
d) The focus of efforts should be on prevention of alcohol use and health promotion measures for a healthy life
style. School based healthy life style promotion programs incorporating life skills and other setting based
approaches should be encouraged.
e) Taxation as a tool to regulate alcohol consumption has its limits. The price inelasticities of alcohol especially
the cheaper ones need to be considered. Rational and simple tax administration uniformly and consistently
implemented is bound to produce better results.
f) The deterrent for alcohol consumption should be both at the societal level and individual level i.e., the
individual’s right to choose alcohol consumption should be weighed against the harm that the individual can
cause to other members of the society. The principle should be akin to “polluter pays”. The penalty for such
costs as in the case of drunk driving or aiding or abetting manufacture of spurious liquor, etc., should be
higher. In essence, the other individuals and family members right to “good and healthy living” should be
protected and preserved and not just focus on ‘it is my choice to drink’.
g) Workplace alcohol prevention programs should receive greater importance.
h) Community based intervention programs focusing on health promotion, early recognition and management
in select centers across the country for de-addiction should be incorporated as part of the primary
healthcare agenda.
i) Several governance issues related to existing legislations, for example low conviction rates, drinking and
driving, surrogate advertising, etc.,need to be seriously addressed.
j) Monitoring and Surveillance systems for monitoring harm from alcohol consumption should be instituted
along with strengthening the knowledge base.

Role of NGOs in alcohol control
It is to the credit of the different NGOs that the immense socio-economic impact of alcohol in the society has
received some attention. The Bang and Bang (1991) experience is one such intervention that influenced decision
making during the 1990s. Being placed in local contexts, the NGOs have an unusual reach as against governmental
bodies. A visible example of this is the women's movement against alcohol, especially in Andhra Pradesh. Despite the
very powerful impact, the short term sustainability of such initiatives is a key concern. Notwithstanding this, it is
to be realised that NGOs have a dominant role to play in bringing about a greater reduction of harm from alcohol use.
Historically, the Gandhian campaigns and the Sarvodya movement brought in the necessary strengths to implement
a seemingly difficult piece of legislation (Prohibition act). This inherent strength of the grass root NGOs needs to be
taken into account when one defines and delineates the role of different NGOs. With time and changing lifestyles
and values, the NGO movement has also undergone changes. NGOs with industry sponsored agenda can bring
discredit to the issues and concerns of reducing harm from alcohol use. With this note of caution, the potential of
the existing NGOs need to be harnessed into health life style promotion campaigns across the country.

Research priorities regarding alcohol
Even though alcohol related harm is now well acknowledged in India, a research focus to address specific issues
and develop an evidence base has been lacking. In a recent review of research in substance abuse problems in
India, Murthy et al (2010) highlight that research has not kept pace with the increasing use, changing pattern
and associated harm from alcohol in India. Earlier research efforts have been adhoc, researcher interest based
and carried out on smaller populations, with the exception of a few nationally representative studies.
Much of the research in the past has been on estimating prevalence and patterns of use in diverse populations.
Most of these are ultimately incomparable due to methodological differences of sample size, population
characteristics, nonstandardised methodologies, and varying interpretations. Research on factors and
determinants that predispose individuals to alcohol use, the natural history of alcoholism, course and outcome of
alcohol related health conditions and clear linkages of alcohol to other conditions like NCDs are critical areas
meriting attention in the Indian scenario. The larger socioeconomic and psychosocial impact, especially on
vulnerable populations has received scant attention in the country. There is need for more research on both
psychosocial and neurogenetic risk and predisposing factors that will help in prevention, early recognition and
management. Information on what type of interventions work and in what kind of setting is critical to formulate
rational, evidence based national guidelines. There is need to identify vulnerability markers and traits predisposing
to alcohol use, co-morbidity and other risk behaviors. A major prerequisite is also the need for data from
nationally representative samples from different geographic regions using standardized methodologies.
Given the scarcity of available data and the need for better information for action, we propose the following
research priorities for India to be addressed in the next 5 - 10 years to bridge existing gaps in our understanding
of alcohol related harm.
1. With NCDs and injuries emerging as a leading contributor for death and disability and their likely increase
in the coming years, the association and contributions of alcohol has to be delineated scientifically and
systematically.
2. To reduce early initiation of young and vulnerable individuals to alcohol use, the role and contribution of
several social (including media), economic, psychological, neurogenetic and other factors that increase
vulnerability of individuals to alcohol needs to be understood for preventing harm from alcohol.
3. The socioeconomic and psychosocial impact of alcohol needs to be researched adequately with well defined
research methodologies that move beyond numbers to examine the impact on quality of life and its impact
on the larger society.
4. To examine the effectiveness of strategies that reduce harm from alcohol, there is a need for integrated
population and hospital based research that addresses the critical question of the efficacy and effectiveness
of different setting based interventions.
5. Most importantly, there is need for policy and community oriented research to learn from previous efforts
and to set directions for policy frameworks that work on an intersectoral basis for implementation along
with monitoring and evaluation.
These priorities cannot be addressed in the absence of rational and grounded operational mechanisms. To
promote, facilitate and implement this strong research focus, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare needs to
strengthen the Regional Centers to develop a strong population research base in addition to their clinical service
and training focus. A direction to strengthen both basic and clinical research and adequate support should be
provided. This includes supportive facilities of manpower, budget, equipment and necessary infrastructure to
carry out research on a long term basis. The centers can also become centers for capacity strengthening, human
resource development, advocacy, intervention development, community activities, monitoring and evaluation.

Role of communities in alcohol control
The present day communities have reacted differentially with respect to increasing use of alcohol. The changing
life style particularly in urban India which also includes alcohol use seems to be more tolerable. What is indeed
noteworthy is the manner in which the women in the community have empowered themselves albeit in a small but
significant way. The focus group discussion in the slums of Bangalore city revealed this changing trend: the
women who tolerate alcohol nuisance by their husbands find it inexcusable to tolerate the physical and mental
abuse ""how can they take it for granted to beat us; if they want to drink let them do so and keep quiet"". The
financially empowered women now find it relatively easy to assert themselves and demand something better for
themselves. This sort of a trend is also visible in the rural areas wherein the women's self help groups have surely
dealt a blow to the male bastion. Notwithstanding these positive developments, there still remains the larger
issue of domestic violence link to alcohol use in number of households. The value systems of the past responsible
for the prohibition agenda is being replaced with emerging trends of increasing consumption of wine and drinking
among women.
Between this established pattern of male drinking aand the emerging pattern of drinking among women, the
exact mechanisms of control in the communities needs to get delineated. Similarly, in many HICs, drinking and
driving or drinking and misbehaving are considered socially unacceptable, while in India they are issues linked to
power and prestige. In such situations, communities will have to enagage themselves and decide on the permissible
limits for alcohol use. The mounting public health costs cannot be ignored otherwise. Unless the public response
increases, silence could be misconstrued to mean approval. Should one be talking about sensible drinking (alcohol
industry reference) or should there be a debate about responsible dis-inhibition (Galvani, 2004).
Patel (1998) pertinently observes that a community based, participatory public health model to tackle
alcohol misuse is the only way to reduce the negative impact of problem drinking while safeguarding the economic
benefits of alcohol, avoiding punishing the majority who drink sensibly, and preventing deaths and crime which
result from the illegal bootlegging industry.

Alcohol Policies
""It is now widely accepted that an effective economic policy demands serious consideration of its ethical and
welfare implications also, though on several economic issues one may have difficulty in reconciling economic
targets with the ethical and moral targets. One such issue is that of resource mobilization through excise tax
revenue and its welfare implications….
…the conclusions of economic decisions need to be strongly grounded on moral commitments to public policy, so
as to reconcile economic targets without jeopardising ethical and moral targets."" (Abraham J, 1995)
""The conclusion that a certain amount of alcohol can have a beneficial effect on personal health, decreasing
mortality from some major conditions to such an extent that it more than compensates for an increased mortality
from other conditions, greatly complicates the formation of public health policy. Before a beneficial effect was
appreciated, policy could, and generally did, aim to discourage drinking altogether. Policies aimed solely at
reducing heavy drinking had little success and the most effective means of reducing alcohol abuse seemed to be
a policy aimed at reducing the average amount consumed by the population as a whole..."" ""The balance of benefit
and harm from the consumption of alcohol must therefore be very different in different countries and policies
that might be good in one country could well be disastrous in another"" (Doll, 1997)
These observations lead to the conclusion that India needs to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate an
alcohol control policy of its own keeping in view the social, cultural, health and economic implications for its
citizens. The global experience (Room et al, 2002) will definitely help in examining various options that needs to
be considered in the Indian scenario. Some of the policy choices that are effective in reducing the burden

Population versus individual approaches in alcohol control
A combination of interventions are needed to reduce alcohol-related harm - to the benefit of society as a whole.
Population-level approaches are important because they can help reduce the aggregate level of alcohol consumed
and therefore lower the whole population's risk of alcohol-related harm. These interventions can:
(cid:2) Prevent people from drinking harmful or hazardous amounts in the first place.
(cid:2) Detect those who are not in regular contact with the relevant services, to deal with early problems
(cid:2) Support those who have been specifically advised to reduce their alcohol intake, by creating an environment
that supports lower-risk drinking.
Interventions aimed at individuals can help make people aware of the potential risks they are taking (or harm
they may be doing) at an early stage. This is important, as they are most likely to change their behavior if it is
tackled early. In addition, an early intervention could prevent extensive damage.

populations(25), where alcohol consumption

Furthermore, there has been heterogeneity in the

parts of the world.
Research in the latest decade has led to
major reversals in the perception of alcohol
in relation to health in general and CVD
in particular. These developments have
prompted health authorities in a number of
countries, e.g. the Netherlands(26), England(27)
and Australia(28), to lower their recommended
amount of alcohol for low-risk drinking.

A fter the dissolution of the Soviet
Union and liberalisation in what
is now the Russian Federation,
alcohol consumption per capita
increased to 20.4 litres by 2003,
leading to significant alcohol-attributable
mortality rates.
Per numerous studies, approximately 50% of
all deaths among working-aged men were due
to alcohol. In response, policy reforms were
introduced to reduce alcohol consumption in
Russia. These reforms included stricter penalties
for drinking and driving, increases in excise
taxes, setting minimum prices for some alcoholic
products, restrictions on advertising, and
restriction on alcohol availability. Strict alcohol
control policies led to a significant reduction in
alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality.
Between 2003 and 2016, alcohol consumption
fell by 43%, alcohol dependence dropped, and a
marked difference was observed in social impacts
of alcohol (including suicide, homicide, and 11
motor vehicle accidents) as well.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:11","Executive Summary
Alcohol plays too significant a role in society today and should be an afterthought as
opposed to the most essential addition to any social event. Alcohol creates numerous
social, economic, and health problems that could very easily be stopped if it plays a
less influential role in everyday events. The pattern of alcohol consumption by the
different categories of population and its manifold impact on the general society are
of great importance today. The present study has made a situational analysis of the
phenomenon of alcoholism and suggested suitable measures for reducing / minimising
its impact on the populace in the state of Kerala.
The specific objectives of the study are;
1. To find out the socio-economic profile of the respondents viz: Drinkers (Alcohol
Users), Spouses of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers (Non-Alcohol Users).
2. To trace out the history of consumption and circumstances stimulating the
drinking behaviour.
3. To highlight the extent of alcohol consumption across the cross section of the
society (among the various segments of the people).
4. To know the trends and patterns of alcohol consumption in the state and to
differentiate between Hazardous and Potentially Hazardous Drinkers.
5. To find out the impact of alcohol consumption on physical /mental health,
psychological well being, family life, social relationships and productivity of the
Drinkers (Alcohol Users).
6. To compare the status of physical /mental health, psychological well being,
family life, social relationships and productivity of the Drinkers (Experimental
Group) with that of the Non-Drinkers (Control Group).
The study area covered 9 districts of Kerala and the data were collected from the 1031
primary respondents; 941 experimental group respondents - 622 adult drinkers, 229
adolescent drinkers and 90 spouses of drinkers and 90 control group respondents of
adult non-drinkers, 18 case study respondents, 18 anecdotes and 41 key informants.
Thus, a total sample size of 1108 respondents came under the purview of the study.
Further, for a comparative analysis, 622 adult drinkers from the experimental group
and 90 non-drinkers from the control group were cross examined on selected
variables. The tools used for eliciting information included; Pre-tested interview
schedule, Interview guide, Case Study format and Anecdote format.
The major findings of the study include the following;
Socio- Economic Profile of the Respondents
 Of the respondents - the drinkers (adults and adolescents), spouses of drinkers
and non drinkers: Most of the adult drinkers were: males belonging to Hindu
religion followed by Christian and Muslim, in the age group of 30 - 44years,
married and from the rural areas. Majority of them and their parents were less
educated. Economically, most were employed but in the lower income
categories.
 Socio-economic status of the adolescent drinkers was slightly better than the
adults and the spouses of drinkers.
 Non-drinkers were also from almost similar socio-economic background of the
adult drinkers.
i"

adolescents were infrequent or highly infrequent.
 Most were starting their first drink at evening, while husbands of 17.8%
spouses, 16.4% adults and 2.9% adolescents at early morning. Majority of the
harmful drinkers had their first drink at early morning or forenoon while most
less-harmful drinkers had it in the evening.
 The usual place of drinking for adults was „Bar‟ or „Home‟, while for
adolescents, it was „Friends‟ house‟ or „Home‟.
 Most adults and husbands of spouses and a good number of adolescents too
were consuming 180ml or more quantity of alcohol.
 A good number of adults were spending an amount of Rs.100/- to Rs.250/-
followed by Rs.50/- to Rs.100/- for drinking.
 Almost all highly frequent drinkers spent generously for drinking per day. I.e.
an amount of Rs.250/ - Rs.500/- (48.4%) or Rs.100/ - Rs.250/ (45.2%).
 Even among infrequent drinkers, most (60%) had to set aside an amount of Rs.
50/- to Rs.100/- or Rs.100/- to Rs.250/- for their drinking.
 Majority of the adults and adolescents were consuming more than one brand
of alcohol drinks.
 For adults, „Brandy‟ and „Rum‟ were the favourite brands while for
adolescents, it is Brandy and Beer (17%).
 Most adults and adolescents usually mix water with alcohol.
 For majority of the drinkers „Beverage shop‟ was the main source of alcohol
followed by „Bar‟
Impact of Alcohol Consumption
 Physical and potential mental health problems were reported by most of the
adult drinkers and spouses of drinkers. More than half of the adolescents too
reported on the same.
 Personal and family functioning activities were affected for majority of the
drinkers.
 Externalising and internalising emotions were reported higher (moderate/high)
among the adult drinkers compared to the adolescent drinkers.
ii"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:13"," The general family functioning was low among almost one fourth of the adults
and husbands of spouses.
 Problems with family members were reported by most of the adults and the
spouses.
 Relationship with spouse and relationship with children were found to be low
for a good percentage of the adults and husbands of spouses.
 Acceptance in the family was moderate or high among most of the adults or
the husbands of spouses while less among the adolescents.
 Acceptance in society was higher among the adolescents compared to the
husbands of spouses and the adult drinkers.
 Problems in the social life were reported more by the spouses of drinkers
compared to the adult and the adolescent drinkers.
 Participation in social activities was lesser for the adults and husbands of
spouses compared to the adolescents.
 Regarding missed days of work and loss of job due to alcohol consumption
out of every 10 adults, more than 1 had it. For the adolescents, out of every 10,
more than 1 had dismissal from the school.
 More than one sixth of the adolescents were suspended from the school due to
the intake of alcohol.
 Accidents at work due to alcohol consumption were reported by few of the
adults and spouses of the drinkers.
 Decreased efficiency was reported more by the spouses of drinkers compared
to the adult and the adolescent drinkers.
 More than half of the adults and the adolescents had physical fights under the
influence of alcohol.
 A good number of drinkers had drunken driving at some times or most of the
time. Of these, more than 25% of the adults and nearly 20% of the adolescents
had got arrested and held at the police station. Among them, nearly half of the
adolescents and husbands of spouses and one third of the adults had accidents
at least once in the course of action. It is also noted that the accident rate was
more among the adolescents than the adults.
The impact of alcoholism was reported more by the spouses of drinkers than the adult
drinkers. As most of the adolescents were not regular drinkers, the impact was
comparatively less among them.
 The impact of alcoholism on the physical and mental health, psychological
well being, family, society and productivity, the experimental group (drinkers)
had shown variations with high impact on the harmful drinkers compared to
the less harmful drinkers. However, with regard to the control group (non-
drinkers), the status of physical / mental health, psychological well being,
family and societal relationship and productivity were comparatively higher
than the experimental group.
Withdrawal, Treatment and Allied Aspects
 Majority of the adults and husbands of the spouses had attempted to stop/cut
down alcohol drinking for a month and more than 90% of them succeeded in
this. The period of their abstinence was 1-6 months. About half of the
adolescents also had tried to stop drinking and most could stop it for a month.
Withdrawal problems like; unable to sleep, feel anxious, fidgety/relentless etc.
iii"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:14","were faced by majority of all the above groups. A few had FITS/Convulsion or
Delirium tremens.
 About 10% of the adults and 20% of the spouses of the drinkers reported of
the treatment at De-addiction centre while only 5 adolescents had the same.
 The reasons cited for restart of drinking by most of the adults, adolescents and
spouses were: wanted to use‟ and peer pressure.
The study proposes the following recommendations to reduce the impact of
alcoholism.
 Identification of alcohol-prone areas to introduce alcohol consumption policy
effectively.
 Introduction of alcohol-consumption policy taking into consideration the
factors viz. i. Purchase of alcohol- permit card system, ii. Retail sale –
restricting the number of Bevco outlets and Bars, iii. Monitoring visits by the
enforcement authorities.
 Annual earmarking of funds by LSGs, Govt. depts, and Corporates for
implementing the suitable measures to mitigate the problem of alcoholism.
 Revision of curriculum in schools/colleges incorporating the topics related to
alcoholism and its impact.
 Setting up of adequate number of treatment centres for de-addiction and
initiate tobacco cessation programmes attached to it.
 Start a cell at hospitals/clinics/PHCs for providing consideration services to
patients with alcohol use disorders.
 Strictly enforce the law related to the age of buying liquor (21years) and
strengthen enforcement of law to address conflicts and violation of laws due to
harmful use of alcohol as physical fights and drunken driving were reported
more among harmful drinkers.
 Media interventions utilizing the services of celebrities and role models to
advertise the harmful effects of alcohol consumption.

INTRODUCTION
Alcoholism which is also known as Alcohol dependence syndrome, is a disease
that is characterized by the following elements viz. „Craving‟- a strong
compulsion to drink, „loss of control‟ – the frequent inability to stop drinking
once a person has begun, „physical dependence‟ – occurrence of withdrawal
symptoms such as nausea, sweating, shakiness, and anxiety when alcohol use is
stopped after a period of heavy drinking, and „tolerance‟- need for increasing
amounts of alcohol in order to get „high‟(National Institute of Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism). This description of alcoholism helps us to understand why
most alcoholics can‟t just „use a little will power‟ to stop drinking. The
majority of alcoholic individuals need outside assistance to recover from their
disease. Different from alcoholism, alcohol abuse is the misuse or overuse of
alcohol to the detriment of relationships, family life, work, and finances. While
alcoholism is a disease, alcohol abuse is a precursor to that disease. There is no
cure for alcohol abuse because it is not a disease, it is a habit, and habits can be
treated. Alcoholism too, though, is a disease can be treated, but there is always
a chance of relapse.
Alcohol not only affects the individual drinker but also people around them and
society as a whole. It has a big impact in workplace with absenteeism, work
accidents, and lower performance, which can lead to unemployment. Alcohol
costs the employee, employer and social security system largely. It also affects
the productivity of a person. The regular Drinkers have a lower productivity
rate than those of the unaffected workers. Alcoholism may also lead to loss of
job. This could have a cascading effect because if they are idle, it may lead to
increased drinking.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:16","Alcohol is found to be the drug of choice among many youth. As a result,
underage drinking is emerging as a prominent public health problem.
Consumption of alcohol, in the teens, affects their attention span, memory, etc.
and they tend to drop out from school/college. Moreover, teens tend to abuse
alcohol with other substances (drugs). In addition, there is more incidence of
alcoholic teenagers being involved in road accidents, violence, suicide
attempts, sexual activities, unprotected sex and also as victims or perpetrators
of sexual assault.
According to WHO estimates, there are about 2 billion people worldwide who
consume alcoholic beverages and 76.3 million with diagnosable alcohol use
disorders. Many regions of the world have reached a stable and saturated
consumption status while a few traditional markets, for example, Europe, are
showing declining trends of alcohol consumption. As a result, new potential
markets such as Asia have become the focus for industry, which are
increasingly targeting these markets. Operating through different media
channels, the widest variety of promotional strategies are expected to result in a
rise in the production, distribution, and consumption of alcohol in the South-
East Asian Region. (WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol, 2004)
India is showing a phenomenal increase in alcohol consumption, with the
initiation age on an alarming decrease. The illicit market (spurious, seconds
and thirds) consumption is far more than the legal sales. Though India is
regarded as a traditional dry or abstaining culture, yet it has one of the largest
alcohol beverage industries in the world, Bennet et al. (cited in Gururaj G,
NIMHANS, 2011). The UB group, for example is the third largest producer in
the world. India is the dominant producer of alcohol in the South East Asia
Region (65%) and contributes to about 7% of the total alcohol beverage
imports into the region. In addition, more than two thirds of the total beverage
alcohol consumption within the region is in India. As per the statistics of the
Planning Commission of India, 2003, there has been a steady increase in the
production of alcohol in the country with the production doubling from 887.2
2"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:17","million litres in 1992-93 to 1,654 million liters in 1999 – 2000 and was
expected to treble to 2300 million litres (estimated) by 2006-2007. In the
subsequent years too, similar trend is estimated. (Gururaj G, NIMHANS, 2011)
Though the overall prevalence of drinking is low and the fact that there is a
strong gender difference in the habit of drinking amongst men and women,
frequent and heavy consumption is the dominant pattern. Repeated
observations have documented that more than 50% of all Drinkers in India,
satisfy the criteria for hazardous drinking. The signature pattern is one of
heavy, solitary drinking, predominantly spirits, typically more than five
standard drinks per occasion. (Loyi, 2009).
Marginalized communities (geographically isolated, minorities, tribes,
economically or socially deprived communities) are often victims of the
harmful effects of alcohol. In these areas, alcohol is sometimes introduced for
quick profits, exploiting the ignorance of the community regarding harm from
alcohol use. Sometimes employees pay wages in alcohol rather than in cash
(WHO, 2004). Some marginalized communities, especially tribal communities
brew alcohol at home leading to the diversion of food grains to alcohol
production further aggravating hunger and poverty.(Loyi, 2009)
The age of initiation to Alcohol is going down. Different states have different
legal minimum age limits for alcohol consumption with the lowest being 18
years in Karnataka, 21years in Kerala and the highest at 25 years in Delhi.
However, the legal age in India, for serving alcohol is seldom checked. There is
increasing lobbying in the alcohol industry for the reduction in the permissible
age (Loyi, 2009).
Patterns of alcohol consumption vary widely through the country. Punjab,
Andhra Pradesh, Goa, and the North-eastern states have a much higher
proportion of male alcohol consumers than the rest of the country. Women tend
to drink more in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Sikkim in
Northeast, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh in Central
3"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:18","and East India and Goa in the West compared to other states (Economicsmate,
2012).
However, there has been a shift within a span of 5 years. Kerala has higher per
capita consumption of alcohol in the nation- more than 1.76 gallons per person
a year- overtaking traditional hard drinking states like Punjab and Haryana.
Shockingly, more than 40% of revenues for Kerala‟s annual budget come from
alcohol. A State run monopoly sells alcohol–Kerala State Beverages
Corporation (KSBC) runs, 337 liquor shops, all open seven days a week
(except on the 1st day of the month). Each shop caters for an average to an
astonishing 80,000 clients. This fiscal year the KSBC is expected to sell $1
billion dollar of alcohol in a state of 30 million people, up from $ 12 m when it
took over the retail business in 1984. Similarly, revenues from alcohol to the
State‟s exchequer have registered a 100% rise over the past four years. The
monopoly is so professionally run that consumers can even send text messages
from their phones to a helpline number to record their grievances. There are
some 600 privately run bars in the state and more than 5000 shops selling
toddy, the local brew. There is also a thriving black market liquor trade
(Alaiwah, 2010).
Drinking is killing a lot of people and exacting a heavy social cost. Rising
numbers of divorces in Kerala are linked to alcohol abuse. In addition, the
majority of road deaths in the state nearly 4000 during 2008 – 2009 are due to
drunken driving. Hospitals and rehabilitation centres are packed with patients
suffering from alcohol related diseases (Alaiwah, 2010).
The need of the hour is to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding
of the present scenario of alcoholism in Kerala, so that necessary steps can be
chalked out.
It is in this context that the Research Institute, Rajagiri College of Social
Sciences has undertaken the present study on alcoholism to unearth the
intensity of the problem and to present the findings before the concerned

programmes for effectively handling the situation.
1.1 Review of Literature
Alcohol is a depressant drug that slows down the activity of the brain, contains
absolutely no nutrients, and does not help relieve tension, induce sleep, or solve
problems. All alcoholic beverages contain the same mood changing agent ethyl
alcohol, though in varying percentage, i.e. 45-55% in distilled spirits (whisky,
brandy, rum) 35 – 75% in arrack, 10-12% in wine and 6 – 8% in beer/toddy.
About 10 to 15% of Alcohol Users develop alcohol dependence and become
alcoholics. Anybody can become an alcoholic barring age, education,
intelligence, or socio-economic status. Such a person increases the quantity or
frequency and continues drinking even though alcohol causes problems to his
health, work life, family, or social relationships. Alcohol is a toxic substance
that can affect each and every organ in the body like the stomach, liver, heart,
brain, nerves, and so on. With treatment, it is possible to give up drinking
totally and live without alcohol. However, as with other diseases, the earlier the
help is sought, the lesser the damage and the better the recovery. (T.T.
Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation)
Changing social norms, urbanization, increased availability, high intensity
mass marketing and relaxation of overseas trade rules along with a poor level
of awareness related to alcohol has contributed to increased alcohol use. Profile
of clients in addiction treatment centres in 23 states (including states with
prohibition) showed that alcohol was the first or second major drug of abuse in
all except one state. (T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation)
A large amount of revenue is generated from the sale of alcohol. Yet, the
hidden cumulative costs of health care, absenteeism, and reduced income levels
related to heavy alcohol use are higher. These costs are estimated to be 60%
more than the revenue generated shows a study from Karnataka. Hazardous
drinking was significantly associated with severe health problems such as head
injuries and hospitalizations. 15 to 20% of traumatic brain injuries were related
5"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:20","to alcohol use, 37% of injuries in a public hospital were due to alcohol. 17.6%
of psychiatric emergencies were caused by alcohol. 34% of those who
attempted suicide were abusing alcohol. 20% of absenteeism and 40% of
accidents at the workplace are related to alcohol. In a public enterprise, a
number of workplace accidents reduced to lesser than one fourth of the
previous levels after alcoholism treatment. 85% of men who were violent
towards their wives were frequent or daily users of alcohol. More than half of
the abusive incidents were under the influence of alcohol. (T.T. Ranganathan
Clinical Research Foundation ).A study of 284 under trials in one sub jail
(Thiruvananthapuram) showed that 57% were under the influence of alcohol at
the time of committing the crime, including hooliganism, rape and murder,
Abuja (cited in Sinha, 2012). Alcoholism is an unpredictable, progressive
disease, which not only affects the person who is an alcoholic, but the whole
family, Charles et al. (cited in Sinha, 2012). In a family, children are generally
ignored if one of the parents is an alcoholic. In these cases, often all the
attention of the family members is directed towards the alcoholic or his
alcoholism. Most of these children experience some form of neglect or abuse,
Black (cited in Sinha, 2012). Hence, it is called a family disease. An
assessment showed that domestic violence reduced to one tenth of previous
levels after alcoholism treatment. 3 to 45% of household expenditure is spent
on alcohol. Use of alcohol increases indebtedness and reduces the ability to pay
for food and education, studies show. Alcohol abuse leads to separation and
divorce and causes emotional hardship to the family. The emotional trauma
cannot be translated in terms of money, but the impact on the quality of lives is
significant (T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation ).
A study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and
Neurosciences, (NIMHANS) Bangalore, and sponsored by the WHO shows
that 20% of women reported domestic violence and 94.5% of women identified
their husbands‟ alcohol consumption as a risk factor in incidents of domestic
violence (The Hindu, May 03, 2008).
6"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:21","Alcohol abuse and its related problems cost society, many billions of dollars
each year, Rice et al. (cited in National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, 2006). Each year, approximately 5000 young people under the age
of 21 die as a result of underage drinking, this includes about 1900 deaths from
motor vehicle crashes, 1600 as a result of homicides, 300 from suicides, as well
as hundreds from other injuries such as falls, burns and drowning as shown by
studies and surveys. According to data from the 2005 Monitoring the Future
(MTF) Study-an annual survey of U S youth, three fourths of 12th graders,
more than two thirds of 10th graders and about two in every five 8th graders
have consumed alcohol. In addition, when youth drink, they tend to drink
intensively, often consuming 4 to 5 drinks at one time. The following studies
also show the dangerous effects of alcohol in teens (National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006). Elevated liver enzymes, including some
degree of liver damage were found in Adolescents who drink alcohol, Clark et
al. (cited in National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006). Young
Drinkers who are overweight or obese, showed elevated liver enzymes even
with moderate levels of drinking, Mauris et al. (cited in National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006),.Drinking alcohol during the period of
rapid growth and development (i.e. prior to or during puberty) may upset
critical hormonal balance necessary for social development of organs, muscles,
and bones, Dees W.L, Sreevastava, and Hiney J.K (cited in (National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006).
The percentage of the drinking population aged below 21 years has increased
from 2% to more than 14% in the past 15 years, according to studies in Kerala
by Alcohol and Drugs Information Centre India, a non-governmental
organization (NGO). Alarmingly, the study found that the „average age of
initiation‟ had dropped from 19years to 13 years in the past two decades.
(Chennai Youth Times, 2013)
There is incidence even to suggest that the poor are beginning to drink more
than they earn- a deadly spiral of alcohol and debt. One recent study by
7"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:22","NIMHANS in the households of rural, urban, town and slum population of
28,500 people in and around the city of Bangalore, Karnataka, found that the
average monthly expenditure on alcohol of patients with alcohol addiction is
more than the average monthly salary. Using their findings in the Bangalore
study, researchers from NIMHANS have calculated that the direct and indirect
costs attributable to alcohol addiction is more than triple the profits of alcohol
taxation and several times more than the annual health budget of Karnataka.
Extrapolating their findings to the whole of India, they estimate the total
alcohol revenue for 2003- 04 of 216 billion rupees falls 28 billion rupees short
of the total cost of managing the effects of alcohol addiction. These included
the tangible costs of health care, occupational, financial, social, and legal
factors. (Islamic Information Centre, 2013)
1.2 Scope of the Study
The data related to alcoholism is mind blowing and it is a serious problem in
today‟s society. If we want to reduce the figures involving fatalities, injuries,
diseases caused from the use and abuse alcohol, it is important to create
awareness among the public, including the large group of users and abusers of
alcohol about the impact of alcoholism. Educating and realising the impacts of
alcoholism have on the different aspects of a person‟s life are the best ways of
lowering the number of alcohol addicts. Alcoholism affects the lives of
individuals and families at the micro level. However, its macro level impact on
the economy of a nation are equally if not more severe. Hence, a policy, which
regulates sales and the price of drink, is also important.
Over the years, studies have been undertaken in the area of alcoholism.
However, not many in-depth studies have been conducted in Kerala in this
regard. The present study will bring to focus the various dimensions of this
problem. The findings of the study will also serve as a data bank for the
planners and policy makers categorically devising appropriate policies and
action programs. These include identification of alcohol-prone areas,
formulation of an alcohol-consumption policy, preparation of a plan document,

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:23","annual year, marking of funds by the LSGs, Government departments, and
Corporates for undertaking relevant programmes, and revision of curriculum in
the schools/colleges, for mitigating this problem.
1.3 Objectives of the Study
1. To find out the socio-economic profile of the respondents viz: Drinkers
(Alcohol Users), Spouses of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers (Non-Alcohol
Users).
2. To trace out the history of consumption and circumstances stimulating the
drinking behaviour.
3. To highlight the extent of alcohol consumption across the cross section of
the society (among the various segments of the people).
4. To know the trends and patterns of alcohol consumption in the state and to
differentiate between Hazardous and Potentially Hazardous Drinkers.
5. To find out the impact of alcohol consumption on physical /mental health,
psychological well being, family life, social relationships and productivity
of the Drinkers (Alcohol Users).
6. To compare the status of physical /mental health, psychological well
being, family life, social relationships and productivity of the Drinkers –
Alcohol Users (Experimental Group) with that of the Non-Drinkers –
Non-Alcohol Users (Control Group).
1.4 Design of the Study
Geographical Area
All the 14 districts of Kerala formed the geographical area of the study.
Universe
The population of Kerala who were Alcohol Users (potentially hazardous and
Hazardous Drinkers) in the age group of 12 years and above and Non Alcohol
Users in the age group of 18years and above constituted the universe of the
study.
9"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:24","Sampling
A multistage stratified random sampling procedure was adopted in selecting the
different categories of respondents.
Selection of districts
The 14 districts of Kerala were distributed over the Northern, Central and
Southern regions. The Northern Districts comprised Kasargode, Wayanad,
Kannur,Kozhikode, and Malappuram. The Central Districts included Palakkad,
Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Idukki. The Southern Districts consisted of
Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, and Kottayam.
From the Northern Districts, Wayanad, Kozhikode, and Kannur were taken.
Wayanad has been selected for its tribal population; Kozhikode and Kannur
were taken because they have a mix of urban, rural, and coastal population.
Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Idukki were taken from the Central region, Idukki
being a hilly region and Thrissur and Ernakulam have been reported to have
high levels of alcohol consumption. Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, and
Alappuzha were taken from Southern Districts; all three have a mix of rural,
urban, and coastal populations. Thus, a total of 9 districts, reported to be having
high rates of alcohol consumption were included in the study.
Selection of Respondents
Primary Respondents
There are two groups of respondents viz. Experimental and Control Groups
with Drinkers (Alcohol Users) and Non-Drinkers (non-Alcohol Users)
respectively.
A drinker in the present study is one who consumes alcohol. The Experimental
Group respondent category included; not only Adult men but also women and
Adolescent boys and girls, as alcohol consumption has been increased a lot
among Adolescent boys and girls and women. Further, the Spouses of the
Alcohol Users were also included to understand the extent of alcoholic impact
on the family.
10"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:25","With regard to the selection of the respondents of the Experimental Group,
from each of the selected nine districts, 110 respondents each with a
distribution of 30 Adolescents (20 boys & 10girls), 70 Adults (60 males & 10
females), and 10 Spouses were proposed to be taken for the study, totalling to
990 respondents. However, due to various technical constraints, viz sensitivity
of the topic and reluctance of women and Adolescent girls to reveal the
situation, responses of only 941 (622 Adults + 229 Adolescents + 90 Spouses)
were considered for the analysis.
With regard to the Control Group, 90 Adult Non-Drinkers with a distribution of
10 each from each of the 9 selected districts were taken. The Control Group
was specifically included in the study for a comparative analysis with the 622
Adult Drinkers of the Experimental Group on selected variables.
Thus, total sample size of 1031 primary respondents came under the purview of
the study.
Regarding the selection of the above categories of respondents;
The Adolescents for the sample were taken from schools and colleges, arts and
sports clubs, or from De-addiction centres/Family counselling centres.
The Adults (Drinkers & Non-Drinkers) were drawn from different socio-
economic and employment backgrounds including professionals, businessmen,
agricultural labourers, contract workers, fishermen, single women, etc. and they
were approached by going to the particular sites of various employment
sectors. Social clubs or De-addiction/Psychiatric Clinics/Family Counselling
Centers, Anganwadi Centres, Asha workers etc. were also the sources. Further,
the respondents were selected through accidental sampling and snowball
technique. The Non-Drinkers with almost similar socio-economic backgrounds
of the Drinkers were also selected through the same procedure.
The Spouses were the wives of Hazardous/Potentially Hazardous Drinkers and
were from different socio-economic and employment backgrounds. They were
contacted through household surveys.
11"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:26","Case Study Respondents
For conducting case studies, 18 cases were identified with a distribution of 2
cases each (1 Adolescent + 1 Adult) from the selected 9 districts. Care was
taken to include potentially hazardous and Hazardous Drinkers from each of
the district.
Anecdote Respondents
18 anecdotes (from 2 Panchayats per district, i.e. one with a high level of
alcohol consumption and the other with the least consumption) were prepared
by interaction with the following respondents, viz: Panchayat President,
Counsellor, Social Activist, Health workers and Religious Persons, of the
respective Grama Panchayats.
Key Informants
41 Key informants viz: a Social Worker/Psychologist of De-addiction Centre/
Psychiatric clinic a Counsellor/Principal of School/College a Police
Official/Excise Official, a corporate head and an official of Anti- Alcohol
Movements, ranging 2-5 from the 9 selected districts were also included in the
study.
In total 1108, respondents (1031 primary respondents + 18 case study
respondents + 18 anecdote respondents + 41 key informants) came under the
purview of the study.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:28","Methods
The study was both descriptive and analytical. Interviews, formal and informal
discussions, observations and case studies were the methods used for the
collection of data.
Tools
The tools were prepared in consultation with the Chief, Social services division
and Chief, Evaluation division of the State Planning Board.
The following tools were administered for drawing information from the
respondents:-
a. Pre-tested interview schedule-for the selected respondents (Drinkers,
Non-Drinkers and Spouses of Drinkers)
b. Interview guide - for the Key Informants
c. Case Study format - for selected Alcoholics
d. Anecdote format - for respondents from Panchayats
(with high and least alcohol
consumption)
1.5 Sources of Data
The sources of primary data were; Alcohol Users among the Adults (male and
female), and Adolescents (male and female) and Spouses of Alcohol Users, of
the selected 9 districts. Other respondents included key personnel and anecdote
respondents.
The sources of secondary data were; documents, official records, and literature
pertaining to the subject of the study.
1.6 Orientation to Research Team
A one-day orientation-training programme was imparted to the Research Team
comprising Research Investigators from Rajagiri College of Social Sciences
and Research Assistants from the State Planning Board at the Rajagiri College
of Social Sciences. The orientation was co-ordinated by the Chief, Evaluation
Division, the District Planning Officer and the Regional Officer, Ernakulam
and the Executive Director and Consultants of the Research Institute.
The forenoon session was devoted to explaining the study outline with special
reference to the objectives and the modus operandi of the survey. The post-
14"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:29","lunch session was allotted for familiarization with the tools of data collection
viz. Interview Schedule for alcoholics, non-alcoholics, and Spouses of
alcoholics. Interview Guide for Key Personnel and format for Case study
respondents. Mock interviews were also carried out.
1.7 Actual Data Collection
The Research team of 10 investigators was divided into; 1 field supervisor and
9 investigators of 3 teams. Each team of 3 members was entrusted with the task
of collecting data from each of the 3 regions viz: North, South and Central, of
the selected 9 districts. The teams were facilitated by Personnel from the
Planning Board viz: Research Assistants (RAs) and District Planning Officers.
The team of RAs of State Planning Board collected the data of the Control
Group.
1.8 Data Processing and Analysis
Data analysis was done using both manual and computerized operations -
Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Appropriate statistical tools like
chi-square tests were also used wherever relevant. The study report was of both
qualitative and quantitative in nature. The analysis was jointly carried out by
the Rajagiri team and Chief, Evaluation Division of the State Planning Board.
1.9 Limitations
Though the proposed sample size for the primary respondents was 1080, due to
the sensitivity of the topic, and reluctance of the Adolescent girls and Adult
females reveal the situation, data could be collected from only 1031
respondents with a distribution of: 712 Adults (622 Drinkers and 90 Non-
Drinkers), 229 Adolescents and 90 Spouses. Further, of the 45 key personnel,
only 41 co-operated with the study. With regard to Adolescents, as almost all
the respondents were students (school was the main source of sample) with a
short history of alcohol use, there were not many Harmful Drinkers found in
this category.

ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The state of affairs in Kerala in relation to alcoholism is shocking and the state
is deteriorating fast. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption - over eight
litres (1.76 gallons) per person a year - in the nation, overtaking traditionally
hard-drinking states like Punjab and Haryana. (Biswas, 2010). Shockingly,
more than 40% of revenues for Kerala‟s annual budget come from alcohol
(Corporation, 2012).Drinking is killing many people and exacting a heavy
social cost. Rising numbers of divorces in Kerala are linked to alcohol abuse.
In addition, the majority of road deaths in the state nearly 4000 during 2008 –
2009 are due to drunken driving (Alaiwah, 2010).The present scenario in the
state wants the need of having a systematic and comprehensive understanding
of alcoholism in Kerala so that the necessary steps could be chalked out. It is in
this context that the Kerala State Planning Board has decided to conduct the
present study of alcoholism, in association with the Research Institute, Rajagiri
College of Social Sciences to unearth the intensity of the problem.
The data were collected from the 9 districts (3 districts from each of the region)
reported to be having high rates of alcohol consumption. A total of 622 Adult
and 229 Adolescent Alcohol Users and 90 Spouses of Alcohol Users from
different socio-economic and employment backgrounds were contacted and
interviewed to elicit information regarding the subject of the study.
In addition, for making a comparative analysis, a Control Group of 90 Adult
Non-Drinkers were interviewed and the analysis was done mainly between the
Drinkers and Non-Drinkers of the Adult sample on selected variables. Chi-
square tests were also performed wherever necessary to ensure the statistical
significance.

2.1 Socio-Economic Profile of the Respondents
Alcohol consumption bears many stereotypes related to economic and social
status. The society has a different picture about the drinking habits of people
with different socio-economic backgrounds.The present study has made an
attempt to profile the socio-economic conditions of the different categories of
respondents viz; Adults - Drinkers (Experimental Group) and Non-Drinkers
(Control Group), Adolescents (Drinkers) and Spouses (of Drinkers) in order to
identify the role of different categories of people related to the occurrence and
prevalence of alcoholism in Kerala. The variables analysed in this section
were; locality, age, education of respondents and their parents, religion, marital
status, type of family, use of other substances, employment status and family
income.
Locality
The set target of the study was the rural population. Nevertheless, it does not
keep aloof the urban population.
Of the Adults, the majority of the Drinkers (74.8%) and Non-Drinkers (66.7%)
were from the rural regions.
83.8% of the Adolescent Drinkers and 86.7% of the Spouses of Drinkers too
hailed from the rural regions. (Refer to table 2.1.1)

respondents in the different age categories.
Of the Adults, the majority (40%) of the Drinkers belonged to the age group of
30 – 44 years, followed by middle aged (45-59 years) and youth (21-29 years)
with 28.8% and 21.9% respectively. The mean age was found to be 40.6 years.
With regard to Non-Drinkers too, almost similar distribution of age was
noticed.
Regarding the Spouses (of Alcohol Users), most (47.8%) were also in the thirty
plus (30-44 years) age category. Middle aged and youth constituted the next
majority with 27.8% and 16.7% respectively. (Refer to figure 2.1.1)
Almost all the Adolescents belonged to the age group of either 17-19 years
(56.3%) or 15-17years (41%). (Refer to table 2.1.3)
Gender-wise distribution of the Adults showed that most (41.5%) of the
females belonged to middle aged (45-59years) category followed by 29.2%

Educational Qualification of Parents
Parents are considered as the first role model of any child. Education of parents
plays an extremely vital role in the healthy functioning of a family and the
future of their children. It is a well-known fact that family atmosphere and
parents‟ approach to child have an interrelation with the initiation of drinking
of a child. Hence, the present study has a look into the educational qualification
of the parents of Drinkers - Adults and Adolescents.
A probe in this regard showed that only just above 10% of the Adult Alcohol
Users had their parents with higher secondary or more educational
qualification. The majority of them were having secondary (Father -31.7%,
Mother- 29.6%) or primary (Father-29.1%, Mother-28.8%) education.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:39","Use of Other Substances
Use of other substances along with alcohol shows the extent of the danger
involved and health concerns in the alcoholics.The long-term effects of drug
and alcohol abuse can be very severe and adverse. Substance and alcohol abuse
can cause irreversible damage to various organs of the body including the
brain. Substance abuse affects the central nervous system of the brain. Memory
loss, ability to judge properly, blackouts are some of the most common
problems who are heavily into substance abuse. It happens because if the
concentration of drugs and alcohol increases to a very high level in the blood,
the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is reduced and thereby a very low
amount of blood reaches the brain. This results in the death of brain cells. As a
result of which the person can suffer from loss of memory even after the
intoxication effect is over (Substanceandalcoholabuse, 2012). Here, an attempt
has been made to find out the type and extent of substance abuse among the
Alcoholics and Non-alcoholics.
Of the Adults, except for 26%, all the other Drinkers in the sample had a habit
of using substances other than alcohol. A good number (48.6%) had a habit of
smoking tobacco while a few (11.6%) had a habit of oral tobacco and 11.1%
had the habit of using more than one substance.
With regard to the Non-Drinkers, the majority (92.2%) had not the habit of
substance abuse except a few (7.8%) who reported of smoking tobacco.
Among the Spouses, most (92.2%) reported of the substance abuse of their
husbands. Of the various items of substance abuse, smoking tobacco was the
major one as pointed out by majority (73.3%) of the Spouses.
With regard to the Adolescents, a good number (46.3%) were not involved any
of the substance abuse. However, „Smoking tobacco‟ was found to be a
common habit for most among the rest.(Refer to table 2.1.7).
It is to be noted that the Alcohol Users were not only affected by the alcohol
but also by the substance abuse as most of them had a habit of using other
harmful substances. Smoking tobacco was found to be the most common among
25"

An overview of the socio-economic profile portrayed that most of the
respondents viz: Adults, Adolescents and Spouses were from rural areas.
Among the Adults, there were two categories of respondents viz. Drinkers and
Non- Drinkers. A good number among both of them belonged to the age group
of 30-44years followed by the middle aged and youth. Of the Drinkers, females
were more in the age group of 45-59years whereas males were more in 30-
44years category. Drinkers were found to be less educated compared to Non-
Drinkers as most of them were secondary educated while majority among the
Non-Drinkers were graduates, post graduates or professionals. The parents
(both father and mother) of Drinkers were also less educated as only less than
10% had above secondary education. Irrespective of their drinking habit, most
were from Hindu community followed by Christians and Muslims. However,
28"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:43","representation of the Christian community was less among Non-Drinkers
compared to Drinkers. Further, a good majority of the Adults were from
nuclear families. Though, none among the Non-Drinkers were separated,
divorced or widowed, most among the Drinkers & Non-Drinkers were married.
Most of the Drinkers had a habit of substance abuse. Smoking tobacco was
found to be the most common among them followed by oral tobacco and Ganja.
Though substance abuse was less among the Non-Drinkers, a few resorted to
smoking tobacco. Regarding employment, most of the Drinkers and Non-
Drinkers were reported to be employed in one or other occupation. Further,
family income was found to be comparatively less among the Drinkers.
The Adolescents were mainly males belonging to the age group of 17-19years
or 15-17years. The majority were higher secondary students and parents of a
good number were having secondary education or above. Though Hindus were
prominent, Christians followed it in a slight margin. Nuclear families
dominated the Adolescent sample too. Family income of the majority was in
between Rs.10000/- to Rs.25000/- per month.
The majority of the Spouses were in 30-44years age category. Middle aged and
Youth constituted the next majority. Most of them were secondary or primary
educated. Hindu community was prominent among the Spouses followed by
Christians and Muslims. More than half of them were unemployed and a good
number having only an income of Rs.5000-10000 or below.
2.2 Classification of Respondents: Harmful and Less Harmful Drinkers
Alcoholism, a chronic illness is characterized by repeated drinking of alcoholic
community, interferes with the drinker‟s health and social or economic
functioning, and leads to continuing problems. An alcoholic is unable to
recognise these problems or if he/she takes note, is not able to stop drinking
completely. Alcoholism is a state in which an individual loses control over his
alcohol intake wherein he is constantly unable to refrain from drinking, once he
begins (Johnson, 1973). According to Keller and Efron (1955), alcoholism is
characterized by the repeated drinking of alcoholic beverages to an extent that
29"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:44","exceeds customary use or compliance with the social customs of the
community and that adversely affects the drinker‟s health or interferes with his
social or economic functioning.
Understanding the frequency of drinking helps us to differentiate an alcoholic
from an „occasional drinker‟. Any person who takes alcohol is a „drinker‟,
while a „compulsive drinker‟ who cannot live without taking alcohol is called,
„alcoholic‟. Clinebell (1956) has defined „alcoholic‟ as one, whose drinking
interferes frequently or continuously with any of his important life adjustments
and interpersonal relationships. When alcohol enters the bloodstream, it
circulates all over the body. Its effects depend on the quantity taken. They vary
depending on the speed at which a person drinks. His/her weight and the
presence of food in the stomach also make a difference. The percentage of
alcohol in the drink and to some extent, some psychological factors like; which
one and with whom is drinking are also important.
Based on the various factors involved in alcohol consumption, the Drinkers can
be divided into different categories. Here, an attempt has been made to classify
the Alcohol Users in the sample into harmful and less Harmful Drinkers by
taking into consideration a few significant variables viz: frequency of drinking,
quantity of drinking and time of drinking. A score matrix was prepared in this
regard and based on this the relationship between harmful drinking and socio-
demographic variables was analysed. Accordingly, this section is divided into
two viz. 1. Score matrix 2. Harmful drinking Vs. Adults and Adolescents and
3.Harmful drinking and Socio-demographic variables.
2.2.1 The Score Matrix
Of the three categories of respondents, Adults and Adolescents were classified
into Harmful and Less-Harmful Drinkers based on the three variables viz:
Frequency of drinking, Quantity of consumption and Time of the first drink in
a day. However, the Spouse category was not taken for classification since they
are not Alcohol Users and the data on frequency of drink, quantity of
30"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:45","consumption and time of first drink of their husbands was drawn based on their
perceptions.
With regard to the score matrix, the total Score given was 10. Those who
scored above 6, were classified into Harmful Drinkers and 6 and below into
Less Harmful Drinkers. (Refer to table 2.2.1.)

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:46","Harmful Drinking Vs Adults
It was evident from the data that the majority (71.1%) of the Adults belonged
to the Less-harmful category i.e. they got only 6 marks or below. However,
nearly 3 out of every 10 Adult (28.9%) Alcohol Users in the sample were
found to be Harmful users. The mean score among Adults was found to be 5.7,
which is almost near to the cut of score 6 and it shows the vulnerability of the
Less-Harmful Drinkers to become Harmful. (Refer to Table 2.2.2 & Figure
2.2.1).
It is to be noted here that there is every possibility of the Less- harmful
category being prone to Harmful drinking, as alcoholism is a progressive
disease and can be a terminal illness if untreated.

negligible percent fell into the category of Harmful Drinkers. The mean score
among Adolescents was just above 4; which means they are a little far from the
cut off score or Harmful drinking. As almost all of them are school / college
going students, the probability of early morning drinking and more frequent
drinking are rare among this category which in turn might have reduced the
score. (Refer to table 2.2.3 & Figure 2.2.2)

Socio-demographic variables play an important role with regard to the
consumption of alcohol by the Adults. An attempt has been made here to
analyse the association between the harmful drinking of Adults and prominent
socio-demographic variables viz: age, sex, education, and religion.
Harmful Drinking of Adults and Age
Age-wise analysis showed that Harmful drinking was found to be more among
the older age groups compared to younger age groups. i.e., senior / aged people
(48.2%), followed by middle aged groups (33%) and thirty plus category
(31.3%). (Refer to table 2.2.2.1)
It is to be noted that as the age increases, the Harmful drinking also increases.
Naturally, there is a tendency for Less-Harmful Drinkers in the younger age
groups to become addicted to alcohol in due course. Hence, it is essential to
take adequate measures to curtail the drinking among the younger generation.

In short, the present study has classified Adult and Adolescent respondents into
‘Harmful Drinkers’ and ‘Less-Harmful Drinkers’ (Spouses were not classified,
as they are not Alcohol Users) in relation to the variables viz: early morning
drinking, frequency of drinking and quantity of drinking. Around 3 Adults and
0.5 Adolescents among every 10 Adults/Adolescents in the sample were found
to be Harmful Drinkers. A cross analysis of the Harmful Drinkers with the
socio-economic variables revealed the probability of increase in Harmful
Drinking among Adults in tune with the increase in age. Further, it was found
that men and those with less education are more vulnerable to Harmful
Drinking.
2.3 Alcohol Use History
Although, people consume alcohol mainly for their psychological effects, they
are often consumed within specific social contexts and may even be a part of
religious practice. The initiation of alcohol consumption varies from person to
person depending on various factors of which the prominent ones are examined
here. The variables dealt in this regard were; With whom they Initiated
Drinking, Age at First Drink, Reason for First Drink, Age at onset of Regular
Drinking, Reason for Regular Drinking, and With whom they Regularly Drink.
37"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:52","With whom Initiated Drinking
The analysis of the data of Adults reaffirmed the fact that the majority (71.7%)
initiated drinking with their peers, 13.1% by self, 11.7% along with their
relatives, and 3.5% with others (Strangers, Acquaintances, Neighbours etc.).
Most (55.5%) of the Adolescents too, initiated drinking with their peers. While
22.7% began it with their relatives, 18.8% by self and 3.5% with others
(Strangers, Acquaintances, Neighbours etc.) (Refer to table 2.3.1)

Age at First Drink
A potentially powerful predictor of progression to alcohol-related harm is age
at first use. Evidence suggests that earlier the age at which young people take
their first drink of alcohol, the greater the risk of abusive consumption and the
development of serious problems, including alcohol disorders. Although, early
onset of alcohol use has been closely associated with numerous adverse short-
term and long-term consequences, very little is known about the relationship
between early onset and the subsequent development of alcohol abuse and
dependence. Early onset of alcohol use is a major public health concern in
terms of its impact on adolescent morbidity and mortality. In the United States,
Grant, and Dawson‟s analysis of the National Longitudinal Alcohol
Epidemiological Survey found that over 40% of all individuals who reported of
drinking alcohol before the age of 14 became alcohol dependent, four times the
rate observed for those who first reported drinking at ages 20 and older.
38"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:53","The analysis of empirical data in the present study showed that the average age
of initiation of drinking for Adult respondents was found to be 20.3years. In
other words, more than half (61.7%) of them had their first drink at the age
group of 15-21 years. However, 20.4% had it at the age group of 22-29 years,
10.1% at less than 14 years, and 7% in the age group of 30-44 years while only
0.8% at above 45 years. (Refer to table 2.3.2)
With regard to the Adolescents, a significant number (33.6%) had their first
drink at below 14years while the remaining 66.4% had at the age group of 15-
21 years. Though, the govt. of Kerala recently has risen the drinking age from
18 to 21years, the mean age at first drink for Adolescents in the sample was
found to be about15.2 years. (Refer to table 2.3.2)
It is to be noted that the earlier the age at which youth take their first alcoholic
drink, the greater will be the risk of developing alcohol related problems.

Age at Onset of Regular Drinking
It is commonly known that early alcohol use increases the risk of alcohol
addiction in the later years. The regular use of alcohol in early adolescence
40"

at a time when physiological and social conditions (e.g., onset of puberty and
concerns regarding the opinions of one‟s peers) strongly support continued and

Drinking alone, is a much more pure and forthright form of imbibing, because
it focuses entirely on the simple act of putting alcohol into the bloodstream. It
tosses aside all the half-hearted pretensions about merely using alcohol as a
social tool as in the case of drinking in the company of others.
About three fourth of the Adults, 96.5% of the Adolescents and husbands of

2.4 Extent, Trend, and Patterns of Alcohol Consumption
It is generally observed that variations in alcohol consumption are based on
factors like; types of beverages consumed preferentially, occasions on which
consumption typically occurs, drinking levels that are considered normal and
population subgroups for whom drinking is considered acceptable.
This section highlights the extent, trends and patterns of alcohol consumption
among the Alcohol Users in the state of Kerala. The variables considered in
this regard were; frequency of drinking, usual time of first drink in a day, usual
place of drink, pattern of use, estimated daily use of alcohol, type of alcohol
used, average amount spent for alcohol daily and usual mix with alcohol.
Besides, a cross analysis of the data with the Harmful drinking of Adults was
also carried out wherever necessary.
Frequency of Drinking
Considering the regularity of alcoholic consumption, the alcoholics were
categorised into (a) highly infrequent users - where the intake of alcohol is less
than once a month or two to three days a month, (b) Infrequent users - where
the frequency of consumption ranges between one to two days in a week to
three to four days in a week (c) frequent users - who consume alcohol nearly
every day or every day and (d) highly frequent users - who consume alcohol
more than once a day or more than twice a day.
Among the Adults, the data showed that 34.1% were frequent users and 5 %
were highly frequent users of alcohol. On the contrary, 48.2% belonged to
infrequent category and 12.7% to highly infrequent category.
45"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:60","With regard to Adolescents, only a few (6.1%) were found to be frequent
(3.5%) or highly frequent (2.6%) users of alcohol whereas a great majority
(93.9%) of them were infrequent (29.7%) or highly infrequent (64.2%).
Most (63.3%) of the Spouses in the sample reported that their husbands were
frequent (53.3%) or highly frequent (10%) users of alcohol. 18.9% and 17.7%
opined of their husbands‟ frequency of drinking as infrequent and highly
infrequent respectively(Refer to table 2.4.1).
It is to be noted here that while initiating measures to minimize alcoholism,
care should be taken to focus more on highly infrequent and infrequent users,
as they are prone to become Harmful Drinkers.

morning drinking is considered as a habit of Harmful Drinkers.
The intake of first drink in early morning was found to be comparatively more
among the Adults (16.4%) than the Adolescents (2.2%). However, the opinions
of Spouses regarding their husbands‟ early morning drinking were reported to
be slightly higher (17.8%). Majority of the Adults (61.4%) and Adolescents
(73.4%) have their first drink at evenings. 58.9% of the Spouses too reported of

Early morning drinking has to be seen seriously because those who consume
alcohol at early morning have problems in performing day-to-day tasks.
Morning drinking, in some cases is a resort to handle the hangover i.e. the
feeling of illness and unpleasant physical symptoms in the morning after an

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:62","evening of heavy drinking. The regular drinking in the early hours of the day
can leave the person more alcohol dependent and later weaken the organism.
Usual Place of Drink
When and where a person drink, the number of times a person drinks heavily,
the activities associated with drinking; the types of drinks one consume and the
drinking expectations and behaviours make up one‟s drinking culture.
For most of the Adults, their usual place of drink was „Bar‟ (26.5%) or Home
(23.9%) whereas for Adolescents, it was „Friends‟ house‟ (32.8%) or „Home‟
(24%). Almost half (47.7%) of the Spouses reported that their husbands‟ usual
place of drink is „Bar‟ followed by 30% stated it as „Home‟. Though, drinking
at public places is prohibited, a good number of Adults (17.2%), Adolescents
(10.5%) and Spouses (12.2%) reported of the same. (Refer to table 2.4.4).
Unfortunately, a good number of Adolescents are found to be drinking at their
own home, which shows a changing culture of Keralites.

Adults were consuming alcohol at similar amounts every day. However,
47.6%of the Adolescents and 52.9% of the Adults had a consumption pattern of

The amount of alcohol consumed is of importance, because the alcohol content
of beverages is a key risk factor for its various adverse consequences. Alcohol
content of beverages is a key risk factor for its various adverse consequences as
a biochemical agent in the development of chronic health problems, as an
intoxicant involved in accidents and other acute problems, and as a
dependence-causing substance in chronic problems (Midanik & Room,
1992)(WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol, 2004).
The empirical data in this regard revealed that most (62.2%) of the Adults were
consuming about 180ml or more quantity of alcohol. 56.7% of the Spouses too

Only the data of Adults were analysed here, as most of the Adolescents and

The data revealed that on an average of Rs.130/- has been spent by the Adult
Alcohol Users in a day for their drinking. It is varied from below Rs.25/- to
more than Rs. 500/- according to frequency and quantity of drinking. However,
a good percentage (34.1) were spending an amount ranging from Rs.100/- to
Rs.250/- for drinking followed by 22.8% spending between Rs.50/- to Rs.100/-.
A cross examination of the data with the Frequency of Drinking showed that
almost all among the highly frequent Drinkers (more than once in a day) spent
generously for drinking i.e. an amount of Rs.250/ - Rs.500/- (48.4%) or Rs.100/
- Rs.250/ (45.2%) daily. However, among the frequent Drinkers (daily or

– Rs.250/- for the same. Alarmingly, even among infrequent Drinkers, most
(60%) had to set aside an amount of Rs. 50/- to Rs.100/- or Rs.100/- to
Rs.250/- for their drinking habit (Refer to table 2.4.7).

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:65","Unfortunately, it is seen that a good number of Keralites are setting aside a

Type of Alcohol Used
Type of alcohol used is an important variable to find out the strength of the
alcohol consumed. The choice of brands may vary according to different
aspects viz; taste, price, content of alcohol etc. The present study had a look
into the most favourite brand of Alcohol Users in the state of Kerala.
A probe in this regard showed that majority of the Adults (45.8%) and
Adolescents (50.7%) reported that they have consumed more than one type of
alcohol brands. However, „Brandy‟ (31.5%) and „Rum‟ (10.8%) were found to
be the most favourite brands for Adults (31.5%),and Brandy (18%) and Beer
51"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:66","(17.9%)for the Adolescents. A great majority (55.6%) of the Spouses too
confirmed „Brandy‟ as their husbands‟ favourite brand. (Refer to table 2.4.8).
It was also learned from the interactions that for most of the Spouses who have
not much knowledge about the various brands, ‘Brandy’ was a common brand
name for them.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:67","According to the statistics of 2001-2008 (data from state beverages
corporation) the most selling brand in Kerala was found to be „Rum‟ followed
by Brandy. 60% of the total liquor sold in 2008 was „Rum‟ whereas 38% was
Brandy. Whisky (1%) and Gin/Wine/Vodka (1%) constituted only a meagre
percent. Interestingly, out of the 10 most selling Indian Manufactured Foreign
Liquor (IMFL) brands, 7 were brands of Rum while 3 were of Brandy as per
the data in 2008. Further, all of the Rum brands in the list were low cost, i.e.
price is varied from Rs.150 to Rs.225/- for 750ml. However, the price of
brands of Brandy in the list is found to be higher than that of Rum, i.e. Rs.295
for 750ml (Refer to table 2.4.9 & 2.4.10).
Nevertheless, the statistics in 2013 reflected a change in the drinking
preference of Keralites. As said in an article on the daily news „Times of India‟
on 25th December 2013, Rum, the favorite drink of tipplers in Kerala, lost its
edge to brandy in the market. Reflecting a change in the drinking preference of
Malayalis, brandy is now topping the drink lists of party planners. Different
brands of rum, which accounted for more than half of the market share till two
years ago, dropped to 47%, while brandy registered 48%, Bevco sales figures
between April 1 and October 31, 2013, said. Since the Rum brands are cheaper
than brandy brands, the manufacturers are prompting to push the latter into the
market. Suppliers also prefer supplying brandy than rum. According to
Beverage sources, though different brands of rum, especially Old Cask, have
high demand, the supply has been found to be inadequate. (Sai Kiran, Times of
India, 2013)
Further, as per the data for the month of December 2013, of the three top
selling IMF liquors in the state, two were the brands of Brandy while in 2008
all the top 3 brands were of Rum. (Refer to table 2.4.11)
Thus, the statistics 2013 corroborated with the findings of the present study
that the preference of Keralites has changed from Rum to Brandy.

Usual Mix with Alcohol
Though, most of the Alcohol Users were unaware, the selection of liquids for
diluting alcohol has an important role in the pure alcohol consumption. Some
uses Water, Soda, Carbonated drinks, or Beer to mix with alcohol, while others
use it dry (without mix). Each of these mixing liquids has a different absorption
process. Carbonated beverages speed up the absorption process of alcohol
while water and fruits mixed with alcohol slow the absorption process. Carbon
dioxide speeds the alcohol absorption and creates a rapid rise in Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC). Distilled liquor, which is highly concentrated alcohol,
enters the blood-stream faster than beer and wine, although their alcohol
content is equivalent. This can make individuals more susceptible to alcohol
toxicity (Prevention Resource Guide, 1990). It is safer to use water to dilute
the alcohol.
A probe in this regard showed that the majority of the Adults (74.6%) and
Adolescents (52%) usually use water for diluting the alcohol. Most (68.9%) of
55"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:70","the Spouses too kept the same view on their husbands drinking pattern. Soda
was found to be more usual among Adolescents (21.8%) compared to Adults
(15.1%) and husbands of Spouses (17.8%) in the sample. Of those who
reported of the dry consumption of alcohol (19.2% Adolescents and 3.7%
Adults), most were found to be using beer as their brand (Refer to table 2.4.10).
It is also learnt from the field that water is mainly used by those who are
buying liquor from the Beverages Corporation and soda is by those who are
consuming alcohol from Bar.

A summing up of the extent, trend and pattern of alcohol consumption
portrayed that most of the Adults were either infrequent or frequent users
(daily or near to daily) of alcohol while Adolescents were highly infrequent
users. The majority of the Spouses reported that their husbands were frequent
users. Though, early morning drinking was found to be rare among
Adolescents, more than one sixth of the Adults and Spouses each reported
about the same. Unfortunately, majority of the Adults and a good number of
Adolescents were found to be imbibing alcohol at a quantity of 180ml or more
at a time. There was not much difference noticed in the drinking pattern among
the different type of Alcohol Users as they consume either similar quantity
every day or varied quantity at different days.
Bar and Home were the common places of drinking for Adults, whereas
Friends’ house, Bar and Home respectively were the places for Adolescents. As
57"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:72","per the data of Beverages Corporation in 2008; Rum was the most selling
liquor. However, the present study shows an affection of Alcohol Users
towards ‘Brandy’ which is found to be corroborated with the statistics of 2013.
‘Beer’ has a prominence among Adolescents as it is said to be a brand of those
who just started drinking. Beverages shop is found to be a major source for
buying alcohol followed by Bar. In tune with the same, ‘Water’ was found to be
a common mix in the drink followed by soda. It is learned from the informal
talks with the stakeholders that while drinking in ‘Bar’ most prefer soda
whereas when buying from ‘Beverages’, water is the common mix.
2.5 Impact of Alcohol Consumption on the Drinkers in Comparison with
Non-Drinkers
The impact of alcohol consumption is multifaceted. Evidences show that
alcoholism or chronic alcohol consumption can cause problems to physical and
mental health of a person, and his family along with harms on the society
where he is living. It is widely known that a higher percentage of highway
deaths are alcohol related. Alcohol related crashes are also observed as the
leading cause of death for many of the teens. Alcohol is a factor in a large
number of suicides, cases of Spouse abuse, and other crimes. A large number
of people are arrested each year in the state for drunken driving. It is observed
that alcohol costs our nation, a big sum of money each year in lost
employment, productivity, and other related costs. In addition, the hidden cost
of broken families, abused children, ruined careers, and lives cut short. In short,
the impact or loss on our state due to alcoholism is much more than that of the
revenue it generates.
Accordingly, this section looks into the impact of alcoholism on the following
aspects of Alcohol Users (Drinkers) viz: Physical /Mental health, Psychological
well being, Family, Society and Productivity. Further, for a comparative
analysis, an Experimental Group of Adult Drinkers (622) comprising Harmful
and Less-Harmful Drinkers was cross analysed with a Control Group of Adult
58"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:73","Non-Drinkers (90). Chi-square tests were also performed to prove the statistical
significance wherever necessary.
2.5.1 Impact on Physical / Mental Health
It is generally observed that excess alcohol intake can lead to conditions such
as cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, strokes, stomach ulcers, pancreatitis, gastritis,
high blood pressure, impotence, nerve problems, dementia, mental health
problems, etc. To find out the impact of alcohol on the people‟s health, the
present study had a probe into the physical and mental health status of the
respondents under study.
Health Problems Identified
Though the majority (67.2%) of the Adult Alcohol Users (Drinkers) were
identified with various health problems, 32.8 % had no such issues. Loss of
appetite (11.4%) and Deterioration of Health (7.5%) were the major health
concerns found among the Adult respondents. 5.8% each reported of the
Stomach disease/blood vomiting and Memory problems when not drunk.
Miserably, a good number (20.3%) were found to be suffering from multiple
health problems i.e. more than one health concerns.
As most of the Adolescents were not regular Drinkers, the majority (58.5%) did
not have any of the health problems, whereas 40.6% reported of the presence of
one or more health concerns. Loss of Appetite (13.1%) and pancreatic anemia
(9.7%) were the common health issues found among them. Feet tingling/feeling
nub (7.9%), Weight Loss (6.6%) were also reported by a few. Those who cited
of the other health issues were found to be less in number. Interestingly, only 2
(0.8%) Adolescents reported of the multiple health problems.
Except a few (13.3%), all the other Spouses reported of the various health
problems of their husbands. (Refer to table 2.5.1.1)

Mental Health Problems
The mental health status of the Drinkers was studied using the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ - 12 items). The GHQ was scored as Not At All= 0, No
More Than Usual = 1, Rather More Than Usual = 2 and Much More Than
Usual = 3 for the six questions and reverse score for the other six. The
computed score in SPSS produced a score ranging from 0-36 for each
respondent. The Mental Health Problems of the respondents were again
classified into Severe Mental Health issue (score 24 -36), Potential Mental
Health Issue (score 12-24), and No Mental Health Issue (0-12).
Analysis of the data in this regard depicted that a great majority (84.2%) of the
Adult Drinkers had potential mental health problems, whereas 12.2% had no
problems and a few (3.6 %) reported of the severe problems.
Of the Adolescents, 65.9% and 3.5% respectively had potential and severe
mental health problems while 30.6% had no such issues.
Among the Spouses, 73.3% stated about the potential health issues and 15.6%
about the severe mental health issues of their husbands whereas 11.1% reported
of no mental health issues. (Refer to table 2.5.1.2)

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:77","2.5.2 Impact on Psychological well being
Alcoholism is a progressive disease that impairs the psychological, emotional,
and physical health of both the alcoholic and his or her family. Alcoholism has
been labelled as a „family disease‟ because its effects lead to dysfunctional
roles and behaviours of the alcoholic and their family members. The family,
friends, employers and communities all suffer along with the heavy drinker.
The present study examined the relationship between alcohol consumption and
psychological well being of Alcohol Users. The psychological well being of the
respondents were analysed by probing the problems they faced related to;
Personal functioning, Functioning of family, Internalising emotions,
Externalising emotions and Academic activities of Adolescents.
Problems in Personal Functioning
The psychological well being related to personal functioning was assessed
using five dimensions of personal functioning for Adults/Spouses and three
dimensions for Adolescents; scored as Most of the Time (3), Sometimes (2) and
Never (1). The computed score of the questions produced a score ranging from
5 to 15 for Adults/Spouse and 3 to 9 for Adolescents. Higher scores indicated
more problems with personal functioning. The scores obtained were further
classified into Low (5-8.3 for Adults, 3-5 for Adolescents), Moderate (8.3-11.6
for Adults, 5.1-7 for Adolescents), and High (11.6-15 for Adults 7.1-9 for
Adolescents).
With regard to Adult Drinkers, a good number (45.3%) had moderate (32.8%)
to high level (14.5%) problems in functioning of their personal activities.
Of the Adolescents, more than half of them had moderate (37.1%) to high
(15.7%) level problems.
However, more than three fourth of the Spouses had perceived of moderate
(50%) to high (25.6%) level problems due to alcoholism on the personal
functioning of their husband. (Refer to table no. 2.5.2.1)

responses of Spouses were not collected in this regard as the responses were
based on their perception only.
The empirical data in this regard showed that Moderate to High level emotions
were comparatively higher among the Adult (45.5%) Alcohol Users than the
Adolescent (26.3%) Alcohol Users. (Refer to table no. 2.5.2.5)

Impact on Academic Activities of Adolescents
The impact of alcoholism on the psychological well being of Adolescents
related to their academic activities was assessed using four dimensions; scored
68"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:83","as Most of the Time (3), Sometimes (2) and Never (1). The computed score of
the questions produced a score ranging from 4 to 12. Higher scores indicated
more negative impact of alcoholism on academic activities. The scores
obtained were further classified into Low (4-6.5), Moderate (6.6-9.1) and High
(9.2-12).
More than 60% of the Adolescents had either moderate (34.1%) or high
(27.1%) level of impact of alcoholism on their academic activities while the
rest reported of the impact at normal (Low) level. (Refer to table 2.5.2.9)
Thus, the data proved that though most of the Adolescents were not Harmful
Drinkers, the drinking habit had a great impact on their academic activities.

2.5.5 Impact on Productivity
The workplace is likely to reflect the alcohol issues experienced in the general
community. Alcohol burdens individuals, industry, and society in terms of
health, social and economic costs and as such signal a major public health
problem. The workplace presents particular challenges when attempting to
address alcohol and other drug related issues, in part due to the potential for
serious harm arising from accidents, injuries, and productivity implications.
Alcohol related harm in the workplace may manifest in terms of physical harm,
such as fatalities and injuries, and productivity related implications, such as a
reduction in the available workforce or poor performance. In addition, alcohol
adversely impacts workplace culture and morale and the health and welfare of
the workforce. (Lindsay Breugem, 2006)
The variables discussed in this section were, Number of days missed from job,
loss of pay, loss of job, disciplinary actions taken, demotion, suspension,
accidents at work, decreased efficiency, physical fights, drunken driving,
arrests by the police, and accidents.

Though majority of the Adults in the sample had either not responded to the
query or not missed any days of work during the last month, 83 (13.3%)
reported that they were absent or had missed days of work due to alcohol
consumption. Of these, the majority (67 – 10.8%) had missed 1 – 7 days of
work in the last month. The responses of Spouses in this regard were not
obtained. (Refer to table 2.5.5.1)

reported more by the Spouses of Drinkers than the Adult Drinkers. As most of
the Adolescents were not regular Drinkers, the impact was found to be
comparatively less among them.
The majority of the Adult Drinkers/Alcohol Users and husbands’ of Spouses
had physical and potential mental health problems. Though, comparatively less

regard to impact on personal being, though the majority of the Drinkers had
problems related to the functioning of their personal and familial activities,
comparatively more Spouses reported of the same than the Adults. Further, the
externalising and internalising emotions were reported to be higher (moderate
or high) among the Adult Drinkers compared to the Adolescents.
With regard to the impact on family, almost one fourth of the Adult Drinkers
and Spouses of Drinkers had reported of a low level of general family
functioning. Further, about half of the Adults and the Spouses each reported on
problems with family members. Relationship with Spouse and children were

Adolescent Drinkers.
Regarding the social impact, acceptance in the society was found to be higher
among the Adolescents compared to the husbands of Spouses and the Adult
Drinkers in the sample. Moderate or high levels of problems in the social life
were reported to be more of the Spouses of Drinkers compared to the Adult and
the Adolescent Drinkers. As for social participation, Adolescent Drinkers had
more participation in the social activities compared to the Adults, especially
the husbands of Spouses. Further, the majority of the Adults had a moderate or
high level of interaction with the society.
With regard to the impact on productivity, of the 83 (out of the 622) Adults who
had reported of the absence or missed days due to alcohol consumption, the
majority had missed 1 – 7 days of work in the last month. Regarding the loss of
pay, compared to the Adults, a slightly higher number of the Spouses reported
of the same about their husbands in the last month. As for the loss of a job, a
good number (16.1%) among the Adults had lost their job due to drinking
behaviour while those who had reported of the same among the Spouses were
slightly higher than that of the Adults. For the Adolescents, more than 10% had
97"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:112","reported of their dismissal from the school due to their alcohol consumption.
Though, only a few Adults had reported of the disciplinary action in job and
demotion, a slightly higher number of the Spouses reported on the same about
their husbands. However, regarding suspension, only a small percent among
each of them reported on the same. As for suspension from the school, more
than one sixth of the Adolescents had it. For accidents at the workplace, 1
Adult and 2 Spouses out of every 10 respondents each had reported on the
same. Decreased efficiency was also reported more by the Spouses of Drinkers
compared to Adults and Adolescents. Regarding physical fights, interestingly
more than half of the Adults and the Adolescents had reported it. However, the
Spouses who cited about the same were slightly higher. Though drunken
driving at most of the time was reported by a lesser number, a good number
among the Adults, Adolescents and Spouses confirmed the occurrence of the
same at some times. Of those who reported of the drunken driving, more than
one fourth of the Adults and nearly one fifth of the Adolescents had got arrested
and held at the police station. Alarmingly, nearly half of the Adolescents and
husbands of Spouses and one third of the Adults in the sample, who drove
under intoxication, were reported to have met with accidents at least once in
the course of action. It is also noted that the accident rate was more among the
Adolescents than the Adults.
Category-wise, with regard to the impact of alcoholism on the physical and
mental health, psychological well being, family, society and productivity, the
Experimental Group (Drinkers- harmful and less harmful) had shown
variations with high impact reported by the Harmful Drinkers compared to the
less Harmful Drinkers. However, with regard to the Control Group of Non-
Drinkers, the status of physical / mental health, psychological well being,
family and societal relationship and productivity was reported to be
comparatively higher with those of the Experimental Group of Drinkers.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:113","2.6 Withdrawal, Treatment and Allied Aspects
Alcohol withdrawal (AW) refers to symptoms that may occur when a person
try to reduce / cut down alcohol consumption after prolonged periods of
excessive alcohol intake. Excessive use of alcohol leads to tolerance, physical
dependence, and an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Alcohol is well known for
its propensity to induce physiological dependence. Alcohol withdrawal occurs
as a result of neuro-adaptation resulting from chronic exposure to alcohol. It
occurs most often in Adults, but may occur in teenagers or children. The more
drink every day, the more likely to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms
when stops drinking. There may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if one
has certain other medical problems. The common withdrawal symptoms
include: Anxiety or nervousness, Depression, Not thinking clearly, Fatigue,
Irritability, Jumpiness or shakiness, Mood swings, Nightmares, etc.(NIH
MedlinePlus, 2013)
An appropriate treatment can relieve the patient‟s discomfort, prevent the
development of more serious symptoms, and forestall cumulative effects that
might worsen future withdrawals. The treatment helps to reduce withdrawal
symptoms, prevent complications, and to get stop drinking (abstinence).
Treatment may include: Monitoring of blood pressure, body temperature, heart
rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body, Fluids or medications
through a vein (by IV), and Sedation using medication called benzodiazepines
until withdrawal is complete.
This section of the chapter portrays the alcohol withdrawal experienced by the
Alcohol Users under study, the treatment they received in this regard and allied
aspects.
Efforts to Stop/Cut down Drinking
It is known that alcohol withdrawal is shown only when the alcohol user tries
to stop / cut down his/her drinking.
A probe in this regard showed that of the Adults, 64.5% and among the
Adolescents, 49.8% have tried to stop/cut down their drinking.
99"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:114","The majority (67.8%) of the Spouses reported that their husbands had also tried
this. (Refer to table 2.6.1)
Comparatively among the Adolescents, those who tried to stop/cut down
drinking were found to be less; perhaps it might be due to the fact that a good
number had just started drinking.

The present study had a probe into the problems faced by the respondents,
while they had tried to stop/cut down drinking. The query was posed only to
the Alcohol Users (Adult & Adolescents) and not to the Spouses of Drinkers.
Obviously, it was very pathetic to see that 63.4% of the Adults and 58.4% of
the Adolescents have faced problems, while they tried to stop drinking. Further,
37.7% of the Adults had faced multiple problems. Multiple withdrawal

Awareness on Nearby Treatment Facility for Alcohol addiction
Kerala has many rehabilitation centers for treating addicted persons of alcohol.
Many of them are very highly rated and are well known for their success in
treating those with Drug and Alcohol addictions. However, it is well known
that there are only very few local self governments equipped with treatment
facilities in their areas.
A query in this regard to the respondents revealed that only a few of the
Alcohol Users were aware of the treatment facility for alcohol addiction in their
respective areas. Around 3 out of every 4 Adults and 4 out of every 5
Adolescents in the sample were unaware of any such facility in their areas.
Comparatively a good number (44.4%) of Spouses had knowledge about
treatment facility for alcohol addiction and some of them (nearly 20%) had
reported of their husbands‟ visits at the de-addiction centres. (Refer to table
2.6.10)
It is to be noticed that though the revenue generates from the sale of alcohol
drinks is very high, a well equipped treatment facilities in the state for the
problems due to alcohol consumption is very less.

longest period of abstinence for both the groups was found to be 1-6 months.
With regard to Adolescents, only just half of them were found to have tried to
stop drinking (this may be due to their recent starting of drinking habit) and
most among them could stop it for a month. Further, ‘Wanted use’ and ‘Peer
pressure’ were the main reasons for restart of drinking by most of the Adults,
whereas ‘Peer pressure’ was the reason pointed out by the majority of the
Adolescents and Spouses for the same.
Among those who have tried to stop/cut down drinking, the majority had faced
some withdrawal problems. Of these, a good number of Adults had one or more
problems like; unable to sleep, feel anxious, fidgety/relentless etc. Though,
comparatively less in number, Adolescents too had difficulties like; unable to
sleep, headache and fidgety/relentless. A few Alcohol Users were also found to
be having FITS/Convulsion or Delirium tremens. Of the Adults, it was found
more among Harmful Drinkers. However, FITS/Convulsion was seen only in 2
Adolescents, of these, 1 had the habit of using Ganja/Charas whereas none of
them had the problem of Delirium.
Regarding the withdrawal treatment, only 5 Adolescents found to have
approached a De-addiction centre for treatment, of these 3 had a habit of using
Ganja/Charas other than drinking. While nearly 10% of the Adults reported of
the treatment at the de-addiction centre, about one fifth of the Spouses
confirmed the same for their husbands.
2.7 Suggestions of the Respondents
The previous sections of the report presented key aspects viz: socio-economic
profile of the respondents, classification of harmful and less harmful users,
their history of alcohol consumption, impact of alcohol consumption in
comparison with Non-Drinkers and withdrawal, treatment and allied factors.
Alcohol addiction treatment is imperative if an individual is alcoholic and
111"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:126","would like to abstain from the habit and to lead a reformed life. To overcome
alcohol obsession is found to be very hard, when a person has been using it for
a long period. Many alcoholics consume alcohol frequently and constantly
without realizing that they are addicted to the same.
This section has made an attempt to highlight the suggestions of the
respondents in relation to: 1. Prevention of initiation of alcohol use; 2. Helping
persons from addiction after initiation of alcohol use and 3. Helping alcohol
addicted persons to quit alcohol use (treatment).
Prevention of Initiation of Alcohol Use
Alcohol use by underage Drinkers is a persistent public health problem. A
strong relationship appears to exist between alcohol use among youth and
many social, emotional, and behavioral problems. In addition to the problems
that occur during adolescence, early initiation of alcohol consumption is related
to alcohol-related problems later in life. The suggestions of Adult and
Adolescent Alcohol Users and Spouses of Alcohol Users were taken into
consideration for eliciting information regarding the same.
The data portrayed that most of the Adults (39.7%) suggested for awareness
generation on the harmfulness of alcohol. This shows that lack of awareness is
a significant reason for alcohol initiation and the subsequent addiction. 19.6%
recommended for reduction in the availability of alcohol and its access, 17.8%
for ban of alcohol and 9.8% for control measures from family. This was
followed by 5.5% who proposed to avoid experimentation, 4.7% to avoid peer
group pressure, 2.7% to keep good company and the strict enforcement of law
while 0.2% suggested counselling services.
With regard to the Adolescents, in tune with the responses of the Adults, a
good number (38%) suggested an awareness generation on the harmfulness of
alcohol, which can help avoid the early onset of alcohol that may destroy their
future. However, 21% advocated reduction in the availability of alcohol and its
access and 15.3% - ban of alcohol, 7.9% - control measures from family, 5.2%
- counselling services, 4.4% - avoiding experimentation, another 4.4% -
112"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:127","avoiding peer group pressure and the remaining 3.9% pointed out the need for
good company and the strict enforcement of law.
In line with the responses of the Adults and the Adolescents, 35.6% of the
Spouses (of alcoholics) too were on the perception that an awareness
generation on the harmfulness of alcohol can bring about an improvement in
the prevention process. The other suggestions put forth by the Spouse
respondents were; to reduce the availability of alcohol and its access (25.6%),
ban alcohol (24.4%), control measures from the family (4.5%), counselling
services (3.3 %), avoiding experimentation (3.3%), having good friends and the

The suggestions for helping persons from addiction after initiation of alcohol
use are very important with regard to the prevention activities. A multitude of
suggestions has been cited by the various categories of respondents viz; Adult,
Adolescent and Spouse in this regard.
The data revealed that a good number (37.1%) of the Adults opted for control
measures and family support. This emphasized the fact that family members
could play a major role in preventing addiction. The other suggestions put forth
were; counselling services (31%), awareness generation (28%), religious
activities, and ban of alcohol (2.9%) and to avoid alcohol addicted peer group
(1%). (Refer to table 2.7.2)
With regard to the Adolescents, a majority (51.5%) suggested for control
measures and family support. This accentuates the need for parental
supervision. However, 29.7% opted for counselling services, 15.3% for
awareness generation, 2.2% for need to avoid alcohol addicted peer group and

Helping Addicted Persons to Quit Alcohol Use
Some people with drinking problems work hard to resolve them. With the
support of family members or friends, these individuals are often able to
recover on their own. However, those with alcohol dependence usually cannot
stop drinking through willpower alone. Many of them need outside help. They
may need medically supervised detoxification to avoid potentially life-
threatening withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures. Once people are stabilized,
they need help to resolve psychological issues associated with the problem of
drinking. There are several approaches available for treating alcohol problems
as no single approach is best for all individuals.(Tasha Foundation)
Following are the suggestions put forth by the respondents for helping addicted
persons to quit alcohol use.
The data showed that a good number (35.5%) of the Adult respondents
suggested for de-addiction centres and follow-ups to help addicted persons to
quit alcohol use. This has highlighted the necessity of medical help in case of
115"

(29.9%), counselling services (19.9%), religious practices and strict
enforcement of law (8.7%), awareness generation (3.4%) and ban of alcohol
(2.6%).
With regard to the Adolescents, 31.4% suggested for „de-addiction centres and
follow-ups‟ to help the addicted persons quit alcohol. Thus, the importance of
medical help for the addicted was brought to notice. 27.1% of them suggested
family support and social acceptance, followed by counselling services
(24.5%), ban of alcohol (9.2%) and awareness generation (7.9%).
Among the Spouses too, the majority (61.1%) opined that the de-addiction
centres and follow-ups would help addicted persons to quit use of alcohol,
which again stressed on the importance of medical help. 23.3% stressed the
importance of family support and social acceptance. Further, 8.9% suggested

from their experiences with the Alcohol Users. They were queried on the extent
of impact and the way it impacted on the alcoholics, their family and the
society. The variables considered in this regard were; Impact on family and
personal aspects.

long lasting impact on the marital relationship of a person with „most of the
time‟ reported by 75.6% and „some times‟ by 22%. (Refer to table 2.8.6)
The Key personnel reiterated that alcoholism affects the marital relationship
very badly; the alcoholics abuse their Spouses, and they became irresponsible

outcomes of the harmful drinking of a person.
Suspicious towards Spouse
90% of the key personnel opined that the alcohol consumption makes a person
suspicious towards Spouse -Most times-51.2% and Sometimes-39. (Refer to
table 2.8.6)

As a child ventures out and experiences the world around him, several
influencing factors help shape him into the person he will eventually become.
Parents sit at the top of the list of the important and powerful role models in a
child‟s life and influence a lot in moulding their personality.

behaviour of a person definitely will have an impact on the parenting
responsibilities as Majority (65.9%) stated it as „Most of the times‟ and 26.8%
as „Sometimes‟. (Refer to table 2.8.6)
The key informants also perceived that the drunkards influence their children
badly by presenting themselves as a wrong model. Further, the family
problems, child abuse, withdrawal from the parental responsibility, etc. affect
the children very badly at their younger ages. Most of the time they forget to
give the necessary care to their children.

alcohol consumption had an impact at „Most of the times‟ (68.3%) and
„Sometimes‟ (24.4%). (Refer to table 2.8.6)
A few viewed that for a low salaried person having drinking behaviour has
been spending a major part of his salary for drinking. Once he loses his
economic balance, he will become a debtor leading him to psychological
problems and subsequent increase in his consumption of alcohol. Then, the
person is forced to borrow more from the relatives and friends and it reduces
his repayment capacity. Some others were of the impression that a regular
drinker could not produce any savings at all.

hospitals and de-addiction centres functioning under the Government.
2.9 Anecdotes
This section presents 18anecdotes highlighting the factors contributing to the
high and low levels of consumption of alcohol in a particular locality. The
anecdotes were prepared from the information collected from the 18 Grama
Panchayats (GPs) of the 9 districts under study. From each of the districts, 2
GPs - one with a high level of alcohol consumption and the other with the least
consumption were selected. The selection was based on consultations with the
Officials of Beverages Corporation (Bevco) in terms of Outlets with the
minimum/maximum sale of liquor in the districts under study.
For collecting the data, the investigators had a detailed interaction with the key
respondents viz; Panchayat president, Counsellor, Social activist, Health
workers, and Religious persons of the respective GPs. The selection of Grama
Panchayats (high/low consumption) was on the basis of information provided
by the Beverages Corporation, regarding the outlets with high or low sale of
Indian Manufactured Foreign Liquor (IMF) during the preceding year of the
study. The 18 anecdotes are presented under the heads viz; 1. Anecdotes of
Grama Panchayats (GPs) with Low Consumption of Alcohol and 2. Anecdotes
of Grama Panchayats with High Consumption of Alcohol.
2.9.1 Anecdotes of Grama Panchayats with Low Consumption of Alcohol
Following is the district-wise presentation of the anecdotes of 9 panchayats
under study.
126"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:141","Anecdote - 1
(Manickal GP-Thiruvananthapuram District)
Manickal Grama Panchayat (GP) was selected as a locality with low
consumption of alcohol in the district. An enquiry into the reasons for less
consumption of alcohol in the area showed that the services of a well
functioning de-addiction centre (St.John‟s Hospital, Pirappancode) in the
panchayath as well as the relentless efforts from the part of a number of
institutions, religious groups, women‟s organizations, educational institutions,
cultural organizations etc. had played a major role in the low consumption of
alcohol in the area. In addition to de-addiction treatment, these institutions are
delivering services like; close monitoring of those who underwent de-addiction
treatment, conduct of awareness programmes, implementation of peer group
activities, etc. Increased literacy and higher education of a good number of
people in the area too contributed in the minimisation of alcohol consumption
in the panchayath.
Anecdote – 2
(Thenmala GP - Kollam District)
Thenmala Gramapanchayat was reported as one of the localities in the district
with the least consumption of alcohol. Working class families were found to be
a major chunk of the buyers of liquor in the area followed by estate workers.
Less availability of liquor was cited as an important reason for the less
consumption of alcohol in this locality. It is to be noted that there is only one
outlet of Beverages Corporation functioning in the panchayath. The low
density of population of the panchayath was also cited as an influencing factor
leading to the comparatively low sale of alcohol in the outlet of Thenmala GP.
The role played by the Excise and Police Departments is reported as a
significant factor in reducing the alcohol consumption in the area. There is
strict checking on homemade scotch by the Excise and the Police Departments
in this regard. Checking is very strict in the forest areas where illegal making of
liquor is rampant. Further, the respondents pointed out that the Mahathma
127"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:142","Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) does play
a prominent role in the reduction of illegal making of homemade scotch among
the female members of the locality. The efforts carried out by the Local Self
Government (LSG) in conducting awareness programmes periodically in the
Grama Sabhas and other meetings had a crucial role in the reduction of alcohol
consumption in Thenmala Grama Panchayat as reported by the respondents.
Anecdote – 3
(Arookutty GP -Alappuzha District)
Arookutty Grama Panchayat is found to be one of the LSGs in the Alappuzha
district with less alcohol consumption. Religious and family status of the
people and the location of the Beverages outlet in the panchayath were the
main reasons pointed out in this regard by the informants. The majority of the
people living in and around the panchayat belonged to the Muslim community
for whom alcohol consumption is ‘harram’ (prohibited by religion). Further, a
good number of males in the locality are overseas employees resulting in the
reduction of alcohol consumption in the area. Another reason cited was the less
accessibility of Beverages Outlet as it is located in a distant or remote region
where there is insufficient public transport system.
Anecdote – 4
Mankulam Grama Panchayath - Idukki district
Mankulam grama panchayath is found to be one of the least alcohol consuming
panchayats in the district. Less accessibility / availability of Beverages
Corporation (BEVCO) Outlet was reported as the main reason for the less
consumption of alcohol in the area. The panchayath is in a remote area and has
only one BEVCO outlet. No Bar attached hotels are situated in the locality.
Further, most of the natives prefer toddy or arrack, than the Indian
Manufactured Foreign (IMF) liquor. A good number of people have the habit
of chewing Betel with Areca nut other than consumption liquor. The majority
of the people belonged to low income or BPL category. Further, a good number
128"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:143","of families follow traditional religious belief resulting in a comparatively low
consumption of alcohol.
Anecdote – 5
Kizhakkambalam GP- Ernakulam district
As per the statistics of Beverages Corporation, the outlet in Kizhakkambalam
Grama Panchayat is found to be one of the least IMF liquor selling outlets in
Ernakulam District.It is learnt that the panchayath has a prominence of middle-
class families having a thirst for keeping a better standard of living contributing
to the less consumption of alcohol. Further, a good number people in the area
are having higher education which might have reduced the drinking habit of the
population.
Anecdote – 6
(Meloor GP - Thrissur District)
The extent of alcohol consumption among the people in Meloor grama
panchayath is found to be low compared to some other LSGs in the district.
The majority of the population in the panchayath is agriculturists or agriculture
labourers. The Beverages outlet in the panchayath is at Adichili. Though, illicit
liquor is also available in various parts of the panchayath, the effective
interventions by the Excise Dept. and the Anti Alcohol movements reduced the
availability of the same in the area. Further, the Women Vigilance Committee
(Mahila Jagratha Samithi ) is formed in every wards of the panchayath and are
actively involved in the anti alcoholism activities with the support of the
political parties including youth organisations.
Functioning of the three major institutions for treating the alcoholics; one at
Govt. level (De-addiction Centre in Santhipuram), and two at Private level, i.e.
St.James Hospital ,Chalakudy and Divine Retreat Centre, Muringoor -; are the
major positives of the Meloor panchayat in this regard. „Divine Retreat Centre‟
has a special wing for the implementation of the Scheme for Prevention of
Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse supported by the Ministry of Social
Justice and Empowerment, Govt. of India. Detoxification, Counselling,
129"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:144","Awareness campaigns, Couple counselling, and Classes are being conducted by
these institutions.
Anecdote – 7
(Thiruvambadi - Kozhikode district)
Among the LSGs with low consumption of alcohol in the district,
Thiruvambadi Gramapanchayath was selected for the anecdote. The majority of
the people here are farmers.
An inquiry in to the reasons for less consumption of alcohol in the area showed
the relentless efforts by De-addiction centres and Alcoholic Anonymous (AA)
Group in the locality. The AA Group organises frequent meetings of de-
addicted persons wherein they share their experiences before and after the
treatment. Frequent follow ups and necessary support given by the Group to the
de-addicted persons were instrumental in minimising the problem to a great
extent. Further, the Churches in the area are reported to be playing a vital role
in this regard through the religious talks of the priests. In addition, the efforts of
Excise Department are also reported to be very fruitful. Nevertheless,
according to Beverages source, the low sale in the outlet is a recent
phenomenon which might be due to the economic crisis confronted by the
farmers in the panchayath.
Anecdote - 8
(Dharmadam GP - Kannur District)
The Beverages Outlet in Dharmadam Grama Panchayath (GP) was found to be
one of the Outlets in the district with least sale of alcohol. A look into the
profile of the Dharmadam GP showed that it is a densely populated area. As
per the historical documents, the GP was a former Buddhist Centre. The
educational standard of the GP was reported as good and has sufficient
educational institutions at all levels from nursery to university Centre. With
regard to the sources of alcohol, the LSG has one Beverage outlet and three
toddy shops.
130"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:145","A query into the factors which led to the low sale of IMF liquor in the
Beverages outlet of Dharmadam GP revealed the existence of liquor shops in
Mahi - a Union Territory, situated near to Dharmadam GP, from where a good
number of people in the panchayath are buying liquor at low cost. Further,
there is a notable influence of Buddhist culture and rituals of Andaloor Kavu
temple wherein during festival season people abstain from alcohol
consumption and discourage others from its consumption resulting in the
reduction of sale of IMF liquor. The role played by the Excise and Police
departments is also commendable to an extent. In addition, the mass campaigns
against the ill effects of alcoholism organised by the LSG in association with
the youth clubs and libraries have also contributed to the low consumption of
alcohol in the panchayath.
Anecdote - 9
(Vythiri GP -Wayanad district)
Vythiri GP was found to be one of the least alcohol consuming panchayaths in
the Wayanad district. An inquiry in this regard showed that though there are
many reasons for the less consumption of alcohol in the area, the prominent
one has been reported as low density of population since major part of the
panchayath is occupied by tea plantations or Sugandagiri cardamom project.
Less accessibility to the Beverages outlet is another reason pointed out by the
respondents i.e. the majority of the people in the GP are labourers of tea estates
and settle in remote areas while the Beverages outlet is situated in the town.
Adding to this, there is no adequate transportation facility. Further, the efforts
of the Grama Panchayath (LSG) and School authorities by way of frequent
meetings and awareness programmes along with the proactive steps taken by
the Police dept. were also effective in tackling the menace to an extent. The
awareness campaigns and regular family meetings of the Alcoholic
Anonymous (AA) Group deserve special mention in this regard.

"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:146","2.9.2 Anecdotes of Grama Panchayaths with High Consumption of Alcohol
Anecdotes numbering 10 – 18 of 9 Grama Panchayaths (GPs) with high
consumption of alcohol are scripted below against the respective districts.
Anecdote - 10
(Anad GP – Thiruvananthapuram)
Anad grama panchayath is a locality selected with high consumption of alcohol
in the district. Easy availability of liquor was reported to be a prominent reason
in this regard. It was also noted that there are no adequate anti-alcohol
movements or activities in the area. Further, the Anad panchayath had a history
of alcoholism. Lower level of education of the people in the area too
contributed to the drinking habit of the people. The other reasons reported by
the respondents were; Unhealthy relationships among the people, family
problems, stress, strain etc.
Anecdote - 11
(Ochira GP– Kollam)
Ochira Grama Panchayath was reported as one of the LSGs with the highest
consumption of alcohol in Kollam district. A significant reason pointed out by
most of the respondents for high consumption of alcohol in the area was the
easy availability of liquor, i.e., there are three outlets functioning in the area
within the 6 kilometres radius, besides the excess number of Bars and the
prevalence of illicit liquor. The construction workers and fishermen are found
to be a major chunk of the alcohol consumers in the area. The other reason
cited for the increased sale of alcohol here is the buyers from the nearby
localities viz; Alappad, Clappana and Krishnapuram. Lack of adequate
awareness programmes on the negative impact of alcoholism was also a reason
cited in this regard. The cultural anarchy is reported as another reason for the
high consumption. The area has also witnessed an increase in the number of
female Alcohol Users.
132"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:147","Anecdote - 12
(Harippad GP- Alappuzha)
Harippad Grama Panchayath was selected as one of the LSGs with high
consumption of alcohol in the district. The easy access to the Beverages
Corporation‟s outlet is cited as a prominent reason for the same as it is situated
near to KSRTC and Private Bus stands. The occupational status of the people
too had an influence in the high consumption of alcohol, i.e. majority of them
are daily wage workers and fishermen. Scheduled Caste (SC) and Other
Backward Class (OBC) have a good representation in the population.
According to informants, the lifestyle of people also has influenced the higher
sale of alcohol in the area.
Anecdote - 13
(Kattappana GP – Idukki)
Kattappana Panchayath is considered as a major town of the Idukki district
with high consumption of alcohol. The Beverages outlet in the town is reported
to be one of the highest alcohol selling outlets in the district, though there are
three bars functioning near to the outlet. A major reason for the same is
attributed to the inflow of people from nearby localities to this outlet. The other
important reasons cited for the high sale of Indian Manufactured Liquor (IMF)
in the area are the importance of the locality as it is a major town and trading
centre (especially spices) of the district, and the high density of population.
Further, people in the area are said to be economically sound enough to procure
alcohol from their spice trading activities and there is no effective „Anti
alcoholic movement‟ in the panchayath.
Anecdote - 14
(Vadakkekkara GP – Ernakulam)
Vadakkekkara Grama Panchayath is reported as one of the highest alcohol
consuming localities in the district. The social and economic conditions of the
families have a vital role in the high consumption of alcohol in the area. More
than half of the population are found to be engaged in low profile jobs and
133"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:148","from low income group. It is to be noted that low income groups are considered
as a major chunk of consumers of alcohol in the state of Kerala. Further, the
low educational status of the people and their lack of awareness on the ill
effects of alcohol consumption have also contributed to the present state of
affairs.
Anecdote - 15
(Mala GP – Thrissur)
Mala, a special grade Grama Panchayath in Mala Block is reported as one of
the LSGs with the highest alcohol consumption in Thrissur district. The
employment status of the people in the panchayath ranges from
agriculturists/agriculture labours to commercial and industrial workers. The
public and private transport systems fair better compared to other places of
Kerala, which results in the inflow of people to this place. Further, famous
tourist locations viz; Athirappally and Vazhachall Waterfalls are nearby and
subsequently, the tourists are passing through this panchayath.
To the query on reasons for high consumption of alcohol in the area, it was
reported as „easy availability of alcohol‟ due to an outlet of the State Beverages
Corporation at Valiaparambu and two bars - one in Mala town and another at
Ashtamichira, functioning in the Grama Panchayath. The illicit liquor is also
available there at frequent intervals in Vadama region. Though there are active
health care systems in the GP, availability of a De-addiction Centre or a
Counselling centre is zero. Change in the attitude of the people towards
alcohol, an increase of wages, emergence of a new culture and loosening of
state regulations are reported to be significant factors behind the increasing
incidence of alcohol consumption. Further, the anti-alcoholism campaigns
organised by the social or political parties were not strong enough to fight
against the alarming rate of alcoholism in the Panchayath.
134"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:149","Anecdote - 16
Ramanattukara GP - Kozhikkode
With regard to the high consumption of alcohol in Kozhikkode district,
Ramanattukara Grama Panchayath was selected for the study. An overview of
the responses portrayed that the location of the Beverages outlet played a
significant role in the increased sale of alcohol in the area. The outlet is situated
in a main junction where there is a convergence of vehicles from Kozhikode,
Palakkad, Malappuram and Thrissur. Increase of migrant labourers was also
pointed out as a reason for the high consumption of alcohol. Further, social
inventions against alcoholism are reported to be less in the panchayath. The
activist groups are very few and people are not interested in the social issues
like alcoholism, drug addiction etc.
Anecdote - 17
(Cherupuzha GP – Kannur)
Cherupuzha Grama Panchayath was one of the LSGs with high consumption of
alcohol in the district. A look into the profile of the panchayath shows that
most of the people in the Panchayath are depending more on agriculture for
their livelihood. There is no middle or large scale industry in the Panchayath.
The Educational Institutions for higher studies are absent and drop out students
are also high in the area. Christian community is found to be a major chunk of
the LSG population.
The prominent reason cited by the respondents for the high consumption of
alcohol in the area is Easy availability of alcohol as the GP has 6 toddy shops,
1 Bar and a Beverages outlet. Adding to it, there is sufficient supply of illicit
liquor too. The LSG has no Police station or Excise office within the area to
control the supply of illicit liquor. However, the absence of Beverages outlets
in the nearby panchayaths viz; Udayagiri and East Eleri, have also contributed
to the higher sale of alcohol in this panchayath. Community-wise, the people
have a liberal approach to the consumption of alcohol.
135"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:150","Anecdote - 18
(Panamaram GP – Wayanad)
The panchayath with high consumption of alcohol in the district, selected for
the study was Panamaram as it has a Beverages Corporation‟s outlet with the
maximum sale of Indian Manufactured Foreign Liquor. Scheduled Tribes are
the main consumers of alcohol in the panchayath. About 200 tribal families are
situated in Panamaram gramapanchayath alone. Females are also consuming
alcohol in some of the tribal hamlets. Most of the people in the tribal hamlets
are casual laborers.
The main reason for the high sale of alcohol in the outlet is its easy
accessibility. I.e. the outlet is situated about 500mts from the town and on the
road side of Kalpetta- Manathavady state Highway. Being the centre of
Wayanad, Panamaram has better connectivity with other towns and rural areas.
Hence, the people from in and around can easily reach at the destination. The
highest density of population was also reported as an important reason for the
high sale of alcohol in the area. Panamaram and its neighboring
gramapanchayaths viz, Poothady and Kaniyambatta are comparatively highly
populated and Alcohol Users in these LSGs depend heavily on Panamaram
outlet for buying liquor. Recent increase in wages had also attributed to the
higher consumption of alcohol than before. Moreover, rice distributed through
PDS either free or for Rs.1/- which enable them to have excess money over
daily living and use it for the purchase of alcohol.
An Overview of the Anecdotes
An overview of the anecdotes of the 18 Grama Panchayaths of the 9 districts of
Kerala under study showed that there were many common factors which had
contributed to the high or low consumption of alcohol in the respective areas.
The common factors for the same are scripted below;
1. Accessibility / Availability of Liquor
Accessibility towards the Beverages outlet or easy availability of liquor has an
important role in the consumption of alcohol in a particular area. The anecdotes
136"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:151","revealed that the outlets situated in remote areas or having less transportation
facility were found to be low consumption of alcohol or less sales of IMF
liquor. However, the easy availability of liquor was found to be a major reason
for the high consumption of alcohol in most of the LSGs. Outlets situated in the
main centres like town, trade centre or wayside of a tourist destination, etc. are
reported to be having a large sale of foreign liquor. Further, more outlets in
minimum distance, excess number of Bars, sale of illicit liquor, etc. increase
the alcohol consumption of a locality
2. Services of De-addiction Centres and Other Anti-alcohol Organisations
LSGs having the services of a well functioning De-addiction Centres or any
Other Anti-alcohol Organisations like; Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) Groups,
Religious groups, Women‟s organizations / groups, Educational institutions,
Cultural organizations, etc. have a great influence in reducing the liquor
consumption in a particular area. In contrary, all the Grama panchayaths under
study with high alcohol consumption was found to be lacking the services of
these institutions.
3. Women Vigilance Committee (Mahila Jagratha Samithi )
Formation of Women Vigilance Committee (Mahila Jagratha Samithi) in every
ward and their involvement in the anti alcoholism activities with the support of
political parties, including youth organisations were found to be successful in
some panchayaths contributing to the low consumption of alcohol there.
4. Anti-Alcohol Movements and Awareness Programmes
Few LSGs with less alcohol consumption were found to be organizing
awareness programmes and anti alcohol activities in association with some the
other institutions. The GPs with high alcohol consumption are devoid of
adequate social interventions, anti-alcohol movements or awareness
programmes.
5. Strict Enforcement of Law
Most of the GPs with less alcohol consumption were reported to be having the
advantage of strict enforcement of law by the Excise Dept. and the Police Dept.
137"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:152","However, a panchayath having a high sale of illicit liquor is found to be devoid
of such benefits due to the absence of services by Excise or Police Depts.
6. Educational Status
The LSGs having people with high educational status were reported to be
having less consumption of alcohol. However, lower level of education of the
people, absence of adequate educational institutions, students drop outs, etc.
were found to be the contributing factors towards the increase of alcohol
consumption.
7. Employment status of the people
Employment status of the people in the panchayaths was also seen as
instrumental in deciding its alcohol consumption pattern. The construction
workers, fisherman, and daily wage workers were found to be a major chunk of
the alcohol consumers in some of the LSGs with high consumption of the
same.
8. Religious Reasons
Few panchayaths under study had some religious reasons for its less alcohol
consumption. In some Muslim dominated areas, the alcohol consumption is
found to be less as most of the males of these families are working abroad.
Further, some rituals (among Hindus) in festival season make the people to
abstain from a particular period. Buddhist culture has also had an influence in
the low consumption of alcohol in a location.
9. The Density of Population
Less populated localities under study were found to be having less sales of IMF
liquor and densely populated panchayaths had a high consumption of alcohol.
10. Family Income
Low income groups are considered as a major chunk of consumers of alcohol
in the state of Kerala.
138"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:153","11. Other Reasons
Change in the attitude of people/society towards alcohol consumption, increase
of wage, change in culture, loosening of state regulations, alcohol consumption
history of the panchayath, cultural anarchy, life style of people, social and
economic conditions, increase of migrant labours etc. were reported as some
other factors contributed to the increasing trend of alcohol consumption in the
state.
2.10 Case Studies
Case studies (in-depth analysis of typical cases) were carried out in the present
study for having a better understanding of the various factors involved in the
consumption of alcohol by the different categories of respondents and its
multifaceted impact on the family and the society.
The respondent categories included; Potentially hazardous and Hazardous
Alcoholics from the Adolescents and Adults respectively. The criteria for the
selection of respondents were based on the parameters viz.: frequency of
drinking, quantity of drinking and time of drink. Accordingly, 18 respondents
constituting 9 Potentially hazardous Adolescents and 9 Hazardous Adults were
identified from the nine districts under study with a distribution of one
Adolescent and one Adult each per district.
Regarding the socioeconomic background of the Adult Drinkers; the majority
were from the panchayath areas (rural) belonging to the age group of 30 to 58
years with secondary or higher secondary education. Most of the respondents
belonged to the Hindu community followed by Christian and Muslim
communities. The majority of the Adults were from the lower economic
background. Regarding the Adolescent respondents, the majority belonged to
the rural areas with their age ranging from 15 to 18years. Education-wise, most
of them were having higher secondary education. Hindu community was found
to be prominent followed by Christian and Muslim communities. Almost all of
them were from the families in the middle or lower economic background.
139"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:154","The analysis was mainly centered on the following dimensions viz.: 1. Alcohol
use history 2.Life situation 3. Personal attributes 4. Drinking habit and patterns
5. Alcohol related problems 6. Family 7. Economic impact 8. Social support
and service and 9. Suggestions for prevention. Further, conclusions and
recommendations derived from the 18 case studies were also presented here.
Alcohol Use History
The history of consumption of alcohol commenced for the Adolescents at an
average age of 14.6 years and for the Adults at 22 years. Interestingly, the
majority of the Adolescents initiated it with their peers and peer pressure was
pointed out as a reason for the regular use of alcohol. However, among the rest,
for one person, it was his father who sent him to toddy shop for buying toddy
and for the other, it was his uncle, the manager of a toddy shop, instrumental
in initiating the drinking. With regard to Adults too, most of them started
drinking with peers on an experimental basis.
The data from the case studies revealed that most of the respondents were
initiated into alcohol consumption by the prevailing patterns of social drinking,
i.e. drinking at festivals, celebrations, etc. and gradually switched over to
habitual and harmful drinking. For a few Adults, it was their employment
situation and additional income earned from the jobs which encouraged them to
adhere to habitual drinking.
After the initiation, many factors fuel the alcohol consumption of a person;
which may be social, cultural, emotional or economic. The qualitative data in
this regard portrayed that most of the Alcohol Users; if it is Adolescent or
Adult had a general tendency to use alcohol as a self medication for the
frustrations in their life. The Adults in the sample have been using it whenever
they have a feeling of loss, failures, severe guilt, inadequate achievements,
conflicts both with family and workplace, economic problems, inadequate care
of the family members, loss of position in the family etc. In short, they had a
tendency to avoid the conflicts instead of accepting it and facing it proactively.
Alcohol becomes the easily available and accessible medicine for
140"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:155","relieving/reducing their psychological pain. Some others had a pressure from
peer group to drink regularly. For the Adolescents, most had faced various
emotional/psychological problems viz: loss of confidence, loss of self esteem,
low acceptance in the family etc. due to their drinking behaviour. Poor
academic performance and disciplinary actions of school authorities were also
reported by a few. Two respondents had health problems like; loss of appetite,
weight loss and deterioration of general health with the use of alcohol. Adults
had suffered severe health issues, family problems and social problems along
with economic constraints. A few had a feeling of loss of confidence and low
self esteem.
Among the Adolescents, severe punishments, critical comments and hostility
among teachers and parents, etc. reduce the self esteem of the children and
compromise on their self confidence. Various kinds of rejections would result
in severe psychological pain and leads to some kind of avoidance mechanism.
Lower performing students should be provided with adequate emotional
support and ensure their self esteem through investing on multiple intelligence
concepts, that each child is unique and are different in their capabilities.
Provide them with sufficient opportunities to sharpen it and mould it to make
them contributing citizens of the country.
It is learnt that most of the respondents i.e., Adults and Adolescents, have a
family history of alcohol consumption or alcohol addiction. Most of the time, it
was their father who has been using alcohol in the family while in some other
cases, it was the other members in the family or their relatives.
The majority of the respondents was found to be having very crucial family
environmental hazards like; impoverished family environment, family having
the history of alcohol consumption, unscientific disciplining, harsh
punishments, poverty, inadequate opportunities of growth, continuous negative
comments, and family with high conflicts. For a few; though they have a good
family relation and sound economic support, their enormous relationship with
141"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:156","the society as well as with the people lead to the habit of consumption of
alcohol.
Life Situation
Nature of work and Work environment
Nature of work and work environment is a predictor of mental health in the
workplace. Work may be more stressful when job demands are high, but
control over how the job is done is low (high strain job). It can also be stressful
when both job demands and degree of control are low (passive job). Further,
work may be more alienating when a job is very routine, closely supervised and
not complex – meaning it requires little initiative, judgment or interaction with
others.
A probe in this regard showed that the majority of the Adult Alcohol Users did
not have a satisfying job. Most of them were involved in hard physical labour
like; Coolie, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(MNREGS), Automobile and other full time works. They were not receiving
substantial benefits for their work. According to a teacher interviewed, his job
satisfaction depended primarily on the intake of alcohol and he could not
concentrate much on his profession (due to harmful drinking). Though,
economically not very bad, emotionally he is very weak. It was also found that
those who have regular job had severe job stress or problems with colleagues.
Some of them were easily bored with their work and left (Probably that job
may not be their cup of tea). Nature of work and financial gain from it were
reported to be crucial in determining their satisfaction.
Current Job Engagement Pattern
Job engagement pattern is an indicator of the extent to which alcoholism has
affected the persons‟ work pattern. Most of the Adults who are addicted
(hazardous) have been unable to go to work regularly. It is to be noted that the
majority of them was not having any permanent job or regular income. It has
serious economic consequences too. Regarding those who had a full time job,
absenteeism was noticed and they were unable to concentrate on their work.
142"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:157","They were under the threat of peer rejection and losing of their job. As for the
students in the sample who drank heavily had lost their motivation to study and
did not want to continue their studies resulting in adverse consequences for
them and their families.
Economic Stress
Economic stress is an important factor for many to resort to alcohol
consumption.
With regard to the Adults in the sample, economic stress was reported to be
very high. Heavy debt, inadequate economic gains and severe financial
problems had contributed to their economic stress. There should be adequate
pay for their work, ample employment opportunities to reduce the economic
stress of the people.
With regard to the Adolescents, nearly half of them were from the families with
medium level of economic background. Generally, these students initiated
drinking as a means to spend the excess money they had obtained from their
parents/guardians towards incidental expenses. However, the rest were from
the lower economic background. Most of the time, the students from low
economic background were found to be engaged in part time works like;
catering services, newspaper distribution, etc. and spent a major chunk of their
earning for consuming alcohol especially „Beer‟, with their friends.
Emotional Stress
Most of the Adults reported of emotional stress due to reasons viz.; marital
problems, family conflicts, inadequate parental support/spousal support, family
rejections, peer rejection, etc. However, two of them stated that they had not
confronted with any emotional problems. With regard to the Adolescents, the
emotional problems which stimulated the drinking behavior were;
disappointments, less tolerance in controlling anger, depression, lack of
confidence, lack of interest in studies, lack of familial support etc.
143"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:158","Personal Attributes to Alcoholism
Growth and development of the person, successfully completing all the
challenges of the milestones of development is a positive indicator of their
mental health outcomes in the future. It is evident that most of the respondents
did not have a positive childhood experience. Parenting was not proper and
most of them have insecure and superficial attachment to their parents. The
same pattern is followed throughout their life.
Overall Stressors
Insecure and superficial attachment led the Alcohol Users to interpersonal
problems with family members and colleagues which in turn added on to
severe stress. To avoid such stress, the persons resorted to alcohol and tried to
be under the spell of alcohol to escape from the distressing thoughts and
problems. Subsequently, alcohol has taken control over their behaviour
resulting in their loosing of capability to cope up with the situations. With
regard to Adolescents, the problems with the family as well as the friends
contributed to severe stress. Some of them had faced low acceptance from the
family and kept the minimum level of communication with the family
members. Problems with friends like; unnecessary talks and physical and
verbal fights were also added on to the stress situations. These factors
stimulated the drinking among Adolescents and subsequently they lost interest
in studies and led to their poor performance in the exams.
Defences
Though most of the respondents did not state any defence points related to their
drinking habit, a few had shown a tendency to deny that they were depended on
alcohol and were unable to come out of it without the professional help.
Drinking Habit and Patterns
Quality of Alcohol
Low quality alcohol leads to many serious health problems.
Unfortunately, majority of the Adult heavy Drinkers in the sample were
consuming low quality alcohol in large quantity. And some others reported that
144"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:159","they consumed whatever they get and not very particular about any specific
brand. However, Adolescents were found to be keeping preferences regarding
the selection of the brand as well as the quality. Most of them were using
Brandy or Beer as their brand, while a few were using whisky or vodka.
Alcohol Drinking Pattern
As usual, all Adults were found to be daily users of alcohol; some were in it
from early morning onwards, while the rest were from forenoons or evenings.
Most of them were consuming more than 180ml per day. In contrary the
Adolescents, (mainly students) were not very frequent users of alcohol. The
consumption pattern of most of them was varied from 1-3 days a month to 1-2
days in a week and the timings were at evenings or forenoons.
Cognitive
Suspicious nature was seen in a few of the Adults. Low self-esteem and low
confidence level resulted in the suspicious nature of these people. Though the
cognitive problems were found to be less among the Adolescents, some have
reported of memory problems or loss of concentration.
Emotional Fluctuations
Emotional fluctuations were found to be very common in the Adults as well as
in the Adolescents after alcohol consumption. Some of the Adults in the sample
reported to be showing mood irritation, continues laughing, temper tantrums,
etc. whereas the Adolescents expressed; mood irritations, anger, depression,
happy mood, decrease of confidence, etc. They also showed violent behavior,
use abusive language and pick up quarrel with family members, neighbors and
relatives. But, most of them reported that they were showing huge mood
variations which caused humiliation to them and their family members.
Behavioural Changes and Its Manifestations including Abuse and Violence
A good number showed behavioural changes after drinking; the Adults become
rougher, irresponsible, and suspicious of wife, use abusive words to family
members and demonstrates violent attitude, while the Adolescents were found
to be engaged in unnecessary arguments with teachers, parents or friends, bunk
classes and display violence nature and irresponsibility.
145"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:160","Alcohol Related Problems
Physical Health
The heavy Drinkers in the sample were found to be having physical problems
like; Heart problems, Deterioration of physical health, Liver sclerosis, Peptic
Ulcer, Respiratory problems, Weight loss, or Loss of appetite. A few of them
were under treatment. But, still all of them were continuing with their drinking
habit. It was also noted that many of them left the physical problems
unattended and untreated, which has a life threatening consequences. Due to
their poor communication with the family members, they were unable to share
their problems with them. That could be the other reason for leaving these
physical issues untreated.
Mental Health
Most of the respondents; either Adults or Adolescents reported of „No mental
health issues‟. However, a few mentioned about the problems like; depressive
symptoms, memory loss, lack of concentration etc.
Legal Issues
Though majority had no legal issues, two of the Adults had accident under the
influence of alcohol and the case is pending. One had a petty case for drunken
driving. One Adolescent reported of a criminal case registered with him.
Relationships
The Adults are reported to have usually good relationship with the friends
especially with those who share drinks with them or provide drinks for them.
Very rarely, they pick up quarrel with them. However, all of them have
frequent quarrel with the Spouse and other family members. Domestic violence
is also very common. A few have very difficult relationship with their
neighbours. With regard to Adolescents; though most had a good relationship
with the family members, two had an average and one had a poor relationship
with the family, friends and relatives.
Family Related Aspects
Role Functioning
The Adult respondents, many a time failed to fulfil their roles and
responsibilities in the family. Some of them had withdrawn from the
146"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:161","responsibilities. A situation emerges wherein their wives compensate the gap
which makes the men feel ashamed and creates stress on them. In turn, there
occurs ill feeling in the family against the father. Mother and children stand
against the father, which again gives these persons severe stress. Almost all the
Spouses have also engaged in some jobs to earn a living for the family. Thus,
the alcohol consumption disrupts normal family patterns and procedures.
Regarding the role functioning of Adolescents too, most were backward in
fulfilling their household responsibilities, and which in turn minimise their
acceptance in the family.
Family Communications and Conflicts
Of the Adults (9), though a few reported of a good (2) or moderate (1)
communication in the family, majority (6) had only a very minimal
communication. And in some cases; they tried to retain their position in the
family by force which had culminated in domestic violence, those who were
suspicious, tried to enforce control and took decisions without any consultation.
The majority (6) of the Adolescents too were in negative communication with
the family members.
Parenting
Though, parents are considered as role models of children, the majority (6) of
the Adult Alcohol Users failed to carry out their responsibilities as a father.
They were not at all involved in it resulting in heavy pressure on their spouses.
Fathers‟ role is also equally important in the upbringing of children. Since they
were not involved, the children may have deficits in emotional expressions,
behaviour and cognitive functioning. So alcoholism will have far reaching
consequences even for future generation.
Economic Related Aspects
Debt
The most significant result of the heavy drinking is financial constraints. As the
majority of the Adult respondents were from lower class families and having
jobs of an irregular nature like; daily wage, agricultural labour, automobile
mechanic etc. they had debts of one mode or the other. It is a common fact that
147"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:162","the alcoholics from the lower economic background keep regularity in their
drinking despite of irregularity in the job and the income they earn from a job
which in turn leads to taking of debts from money lenders or other easy
reachable sources in the expectation of pay off it at the next working day.
The data in this regard portrayed that one respondent had taken a loan from a
bank to make up his debts due to alcoholism. Two reported of the money
borrowed heavily from their friends and mortgage of gold ornaments and land
respectively. Another alcoholic confirmed Rs. 200,000/- as their debt due to
alcoholism.
Almost half of the Adults in the sample had very weak productivity patterns.
They had a loss of job, infrequency in attendance, etc. due to alcoholism and
related issues. However, the other half had no such problems due to
alcoholism. With regard to Adolescents, almost all of them were on the
negative note that they admitted the reduction in their efficiency or
performance as a result of alcohol consumption. It is a common fact that
alcoholism badly affects the studies of students and a good number of them
became drop outs.
One third of the Adults had a very weak or unstable economic situation.
However, the rest had an average or comparatively better situation. Nearly half
of the Adolescents also were from the family with a poor economic background
and the rest had either good or average economic stability. Two reported of the
5 cent land and house of their own.
Overall, the data indicated that heavy alcoholism disrupted the economic
stability of the family seriously and they happened to be considered by the
family members as a burden. In alcoholism, we see a dual burden of loss of job
or productivity and loss of assets and family economic equilibrium.
As for the case of Adolescents, almost all of them did not have any debt due to
alcoholism.
148"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:163","Assets
The assets were very nominal for almost all of the Adults interviewed. In many
cases, it was not in their name but their Spouses‟ name to protect the property.
Even some ancestral property, though they were entitled to get in their names,
was given in the Spouses‟ name by the parents as a precautionary measure to
protect it. That means, the entire family had not shown any confidence in them.
In most of these families, the family exchequer was controlled by the Spouses
and they played the role of the provider. Some of them considered it as
humiliation. The Adolescents did not respond to this aspect of asset as they did
not have it.
Social Support and Services
Access
Majority of the Adults and Adolescents interviewed had either no social
support services like de-addiction treatment/ counselling services, in their area
or yet not accessed the same by them. The knowledge about the availability of
these services is an issue. Dissemination of information about the existing such
facilities as well as the introduction of more such Centres within the Govt.
sector is very important in this regard.
In some of the families, the Alcohol Users have been lacking the capacity to
cope with the difficult situations in the families. Under such circumstances,
some Spouses are found to be brave enough to handle the situations.
Suggestions by the Respondents
For Primary Prevention
 Massive awareness programmes on the negative impact of alcoholism
should be organized at the Grama Panchayath, Block panchayath and
District levels.
For Secondary prevention
 All the heavy Drinkers require de-addiction treatment. Existence of De-
addiction Centres should be publicised for better out-reach.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Alcohol plays too significant a role in society today and should be an
afterthought as opposed to the most essential addition to any social event.
Alcohol creates numerous social, economic, and health problems that could
very easily be stopped if it plays a less influential role in everyday events.
(zomerpenales, 2009). Alcohol not only affects the individual drinker, but
people around them and society as a whole. It has a big impact in workplace
with absences, work accidents, and lower performance which can lead to
unemployment (courtney, 2013). This costs the employee, employer, and social
security system. People who are alcoholic often will spend a great deal of their
time drinking, making sure they can get alcohol, and recovering from alcohol‟s
effects, often at the expense of other activities and responsibilities. Although
people who abuse alcohol are not physically dependent, they still have a
serious disorder. They may not fulfil responsibilities at home, work, or school
because of their drinking. They may also put themselves in dangerous
situations (like driving under the influence) or have legal or social problems
(such as arrests or arguments with others) due to their drinking. (NIH Medline
Plus, 2013)
Like many other diseases, alcoholism is typically considered chronic, meaning
that it lasts a person's lifetime. However, we continue to learn more and more
about alcohol abuse and alcoholism; and what we‟re learning is changing our
perceptions of the disease. (NIH Medline Plus, 2013)
It is in this context that the present study has made an attempt to understand the
extensive use of alcohol in Kerala and the related problems. Thus, the study on
„Alcoholism in Kerala‟ has been envisioned with the following objectives:
150"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:165","1. To find out the socio-economic profile of the respondents viz: Drinkers
(Alcohol Users), Spouses of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers (Non-Alcohol
Users).
2. To trace out the history of consumption and circumstances stimulating the
drinking behaviour.
3. To highlight the extent of alcohol consumption across the cross section of
the society (among the various segments of the people).
4. To know the trends and patterns of alcohol consumption in the state and to
differentiate between Hazardous and Potentially Hazardous Drinkers.
5. To find out the impact of alcohol consumption on physical /mental health,
psychological well being, family life, social relationships and productivity
of the Drinkers (Alcohol Users).
6. To compare the status of physical /mental health, psychological well being,
family life, social relationships and productivity of the Drinkers
(Experimental Group) with that of the Non-Drinkers (Control Group).
The data in this regard were collected from the 1031 primary respondents
comprising; 941 Experimental Group respondents viz: 622 Adult Drinkers, 229
Adolescent Drinkers and 90 Spouses of Drinkers and 90 Control Group
respondents of Adult Non-Drinkers, 18 case study respondents, 18 anecdotes
and 41 Key Informants. Thus, a total sample size of 1108 respondents came
under the purview of the study.
Further, for a comparative analysis, 622 Adult Drinkers from the Experimental
Group and 90 Non-Drinkers from the Control Group were cross examined on
selected variables.
The tools used for eliciting information included; Pre-tested interview
schedule for the selected respondents viz; Drinkers, Non-Drinkers and
Spouses of Drinkers, Interview guide for Key Informants, Case Study format
for selected alcoholics and Anecdote format for respondents from Panchayaths
with high and least alcohol consumption.

of the three variables viz; Frequencyof drink, Quantity of consumption and
Time of the first drink in a day. .
2.2.1. The Score Matrix
Total Score – 10,

 Out of every 10 Adults, about 3 were Harmful Drinkers and 7 were less-
Harmful Drinkers. Average score of Adults is 5.7, which is almost near
to the cut of score 6.
It is to be noted here that there is every possibility of the less harmful category
being prone to harmful drinking, as alcoholism is a progressive disease and
can be a terminal illness if untreated.
Harmful Drinking Vs Adolescents
 Of the Adolescents, most (95.2%) were Less Harmful Drinkers and the
rest (4.8%) were Harmful Drinkers. The mean score has been just above
4 which means they are a little far from the cut off score or harmful
drinking.

(58.9%) reported of the time of first drink in a day as „evenings‟.
 Of the Adults, 16.4% had a habit of early morning drinking while
among the Adolescents; it was comparatively less with 2.9%.
 With regard to the Spouses, 17.8% reported of the early morning
drinking of their husbands.
 Category-wise analysis showed that the majority of the Harmful
Drinkers had their first drink in the early morning (52.2%) or in the
forenoon (24.4 %) while most of the Less-Harmful Drinkers had it in the
evenings (85.7%).
Early morning drinking has to be considered seriously because those who
consume alcohol at early morning have problems in performing day-to-day
tasks. Morning drinking, in some cases is a resort to handle the hangover i.e.
the feeling of illness and unpleasant physical symptoms in the morning after an
evening of heavy drinking. The regular intake of alcohol in the early hours of
the day can leave the person more alcohol dependent and later weaken the
organism.
Usual place of Drink:
 For most of the Adults, their usual places of drinking was reported to be
„Bar‟ (26.5%) or `Home‟ (23.9%)
 For the majority the Adolescents, it was „Friends‟ house‟ (32.8%) or
„Home‟ (24%).
 With regard to most of the Spouses, their husbands‟ usual place of
drinking was reported to be „Bar‟ (47.7%) or „Home‟ (30%).
 A few of the Adults (17.2%), Adolescents (10.5%) and Spouses (12.2%)
were also reported of drinking in public places. \
Unfortunately, a good number of Adolescents were found to be drinking at
their own home, which shows a changing culture of the Keralites
160"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:175","Pattern of Use
 Most of the Adults (45%) and the Adolescents (51.5%) were found to be
consuming alcohol in a pattern of similar amounts every day.
 While 52.9% of the Adults and 46.7% of the Adolescents had a
consumption pattern of varying quantities on different days.
Estimated Daily Use of Alcohol
 Of the Adults, most (62.2%) were consuming 180ml or more quantities
of alcohol.
 Regarding the Spouses, most (56.7%) had also reported of the same
pattern of alcohol consumption of their husbands.
 Even among Adolescents too, 38.4% had a consumption pattern of
180ml or more quantity of alcohol.
The data show the vulnerability of the Alcohol Users; especially the
Adolescents becoming more Harmful Drinkers.
Average Amount Spent for Drinking by Adults
Depending upon the frequency and quantity, the amount spent in drinking
varied from below Rs.25/- to more than Rs. 500/-.
A good percentage (34.1) of Adult Drinkers in the sample was spending
an amount ranging from Rs.100/- to Rs.250/- followed by 22.8%
spending between Rs.50/- to Rs.100/-.
On an average Rs.130/- per day was spent by the Adult Drinkers.
 Category-wise, almost all among the highly frequent Drinkers (more
than once in a day) spent generously for drinking per day. I.e. an amount
of Rs.250/ - Rs.500/- (48.4%) or Rs.100/ - Rs.250/ (45.2%).
 However, among the frequent Drinkers (daily or almost daily), nearly
60% of them were found to be spending an amount of Rs.100/ –
Rs.250/- for the same.
 Alarmingly, even among infrequent Drinkers, most (60%) had to set
aside an amount of Rs. 50/- to Rs.100/- or Rs.100/- to Rs.250/- for their
drinking habit.
161"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:176","It is revealed from the study that a good number of Keralites are setting aside a
comparatively big portion of their income for alcohol consumption; which is a
lot bigger than the sum of money they put apart for whatever other purposes
like; education, health, family, entertainment etc.
Type of Alcohol Used
 Majority of the Adults (45.8%) and the Adolescents (50.7%) in the
sample were consuming more than one brand of alcohol drinks.

buying liquor from the Beverages Corporation and soda is by those who are
consuming alcohol from Bar.
Source of Alcohol

3.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Generally, the Alcohol Users can be divided into two categories viz; Potentially
Hazardous Drinkers and Hazardous Drinkers. Potentially Hazardous Drinkers
are those who used/experienced alcohol, but not addicted to it and are
vulnerable to hazardous drinking. Hazardous Drinkers are the addicted persons
with alcohol. Normally, Adolescents and young Adults constitute the
Potentially Hazardous Drinkers– as most of them is not having long experience
of drinking; but vulnerable to harmful drinking while mostly the Hazardous
Drinkers are Adults and are addicted to the habit of harmful drinking. In this
regard, it cannot be fruitful to formulate similar policies for Potentially
Hazardous and Hazardous Drinkers. Hence, care should be taken to prepare
separate intervention programmes exclusively for Adolescents and Adults.
Drinking during the critical growth periods – adolescence and young
Adulthood can lead to lifelong damage in brain function, particularly as it
relates to memory, motor skills (ability to move) and coordination. Experts
have found that there are a number of risk factors that make Adolescents more
likely to have problems with Alcohol and other drugs use in the future. These
include individual, family, and community risk factors (Goldstein, 2011).
Individual risk factors include untreated mental health issue, low self-esteem,
poor grades in school, and poor social and coping skills. Family risk factors
include: family history of alcohol and drug abuse, poor modeling from parents,
chaos at home, and poor communication between parents and children.
Community risk factors are high prevalence of alcohol and other drug abuse
and availability of drugs in the community (Matheson J.L, 2011).Further, the
178"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:193","present study shows that most of the Alcohol Users had initiated drinking at
their adolescence or younger adulthood. Moreover, the Adolescents in the
sample are found to be vulnerable to harmful drinking in terms of quantity of
drinking as most of them have been using alcohol at a quantity of 180ml or
more. In this backdrop, the intervention programmes among the Adolescents
and young Adults is an urgent need of the hour. Apparently, if an Adolescent
never encounters alcohol or other drugs, they have no opportunity to use,
thereby reducing their risk of addiction to zero. For this reason, experts believe
in limiting adolescences‟ access to alcohol and individuals who use alcohol, is
the very best protective factor for long-term health.
Adults comprise a major chunk of the Alcohol Users in the state; which
includes youth, middle aged or aged. Harmful drinking and subsequent
complicated problems are more observed in the Adults. As per the present
study, harmful drinking is found to be increasing with the increase of age.
Hence, the interventions for this group should be mainly to prevent harmful
drinking and to help those addicted to harmful drinking.
At this juncture, the present study will be helpful to the planners and policy
makers to prepare a plan document taking into consideration the
recommendations emerged from the study. The recommendationsbased on the
analysis and subsequent interpretation of the data from the following
respondents viz; (i) Primary respondents – Adult and Adolescent Alcohol Users
and Spouses of Alcohol Users (ii) Anecdote respondents – elected
representatives, social activists, health workers, religious persons and (iii) Key
Informants - social worker, representatives of the de-addiction centres,
educational institutions, excise/police depts. and corporate bodies. The
recommendations are summed upunder the major heads viz; 1. Identification of
alcohol prone areas 2.Formulation of alcohol consumption policy 3.Annual
year marking of funds by the LSGs, Government departments, and Corporates
for undertaking relevant programmes 4.Revision of curriculum in the
179"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:194","schools/colleges and 5.Other Significant recommendations for inclusion into
the plan document for mitigating the problem of alcoholism.
1. Identification of Alcohol-prone Areas
The findings of the present study, especially the anecdotes carried out in the
regions of the 18 Local Self Governments of the 9 districts in the sample
revealed the following parameters for identification of the alcohol prone
areas/places in the state of Kerala.
 The places where the liquor is easily accessible/available, i.e.
commercial areas, cities, or towns having Bevco outlets and Bars and
places with an excess number of Outlets and Bars.
 The areas devoid of adequate services of de-addiction centres / anti-
alcohol groups.
 The locations with lack /absence of the services of excise and police
departments.
 The places where there is a lacunae in the strict enforcement of law.
 The localities characterised by the residents with low socio-economic
background, especially in the education and employment fields.
2. Alcohol-consumption Policy
An alcohol consumption policy can be devised by taking into consideration the
significance of the following indicators observed in the study such as: Purchase
of alcohol, Retail sale and Monitoring visits by the enforcement authorities.
i. Purchase of Alcohol
 Reduce the working hours of Beverage outlets in the state, i.e. from the
existing schedule of 10am - 9pm to 11am – 6pm as availability of liquor
is found to be one of the major reasons for high consumption of alcohol
in the study area.
 Incorporate the provision for showing the age proof to buy liquor from
Beverage outlets or from Bars as most of the Adolescents (under aged)
under study are found to be getting liquor from there.
180"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:195"," Introduce Permit Card system for all buyers, which in turn will reduce
the accessibility and availability of alcohol.
ii. Retail Sale
 Reduce the number of Bevco outlets and Bars as the anecdotes revealed
that liquor is easily available due to the functioning of a large number of
Beverage outlets and Bars.
 Shift the existing Bevco. outlets in the commercial / cities /town areas to
remote settings as easy accessibility was found to be one of the major
reasons for high consumption of alcohol in a particular area as revealed
by the present study.
iii. Monitoring Visits by the Enforcement Authorities
 Ensure periodic visits by the law enforcement authorities in the Bevco
outlets and Bars as the study revealed that the rules and regulations are
not strictly followed in relation to (i) Sale of liquor to adolescents and
(ii) Supply of prescribed quantity.
3. Annual earmarking of funds by LSGs, Govt. Depts, and Corporates
Even though, a major chunk of our state revenue is generated from the sale of
alcohol, the allocation of funds towards mitigating the problems arising out of
alcoholism is not quite appropriate. As the LSGs, Govt. Departments and
Corporate bodies could play a very significant role in this regard, earmarking
of funds by these institutions is very essential. Specific responsibilities to be
carried out by the respective agencies are the following;
Local Self- Governments (LSGs)
 Allocate a fixed percentage of the Plan fund towards organizing anti-
alcoholism activities as the study revealed that in most of the high alcohol
consuming localities, anti-alcohol campaigns or awareness programmes
(seminars /camps/street plays/production of IEC materials) were absent or
considerably lacking. Following are the activities;
181"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:196","i. Organisation of ward/locality level community awareness
workshops/camps for the various stakeholders viz; students, youth,
adults and migrant labour force on the social, economic and familial
impact of alcohol consumption. A minimum of 5-6 such awareness
seminars / camps should be made mandatory.
ii. Encouraging the arts and sports clubs by providing incentives, for
attracting the Adolescents in its activities and diverting their affinity
towards alcoholism and allied tendencies.
iii. Creating and distributing Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) materials viz; leaflets, pamphlets, booklets on
„Alcoholism and its negative impacts‟.
iv. Displaying posters and signboards at the public places of every ward
of the panchayath regarding the harmful effects of alcohol.
v. Linking the IEC/ Behaviour Change Communication (BCC)
programmes (display boards, posters, leaflet distribution, etc.) to the
beverage outlets for better coverage.
vi. Instructing the Community Development Society (CDS) members of
Kudumbasree to conduct frequent conscientisation programmes for
Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Families regarding alcoholism and its
negative impact.
vii. Focussing more on Adolescents and Young adults regarding
preventive interventions as harmful drinking could be prevented as
there is a time period between initiation of drinking and regular
drinking / harmful drinking.
viii. Allocating funds to youth clubs from the State Youth Welfare Board
and Nehru Yuva Kendra to organize peer based intervention
programmes for behavioural change of youths.
 Earmark a fixed percentage of the plan fund towards grant-in-aid to NGOs
for setting up or maintaining the de-addiction / counselling centres in their
182"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:197","locality as the majority of the respondents reported of the absence of de-
addiction centres / counselling centres in their areas.
Govt. Departments and Corporate Bodies
 Make it mandatory for the Govt. Departments and Corporate bodies to
earmark a minimum fund towards the anti-alcohol interventions
(seminars/other relevant programmes) for its employees as the study
pointed out that harmful drinking had significant impact on the work
performance in terms of loss of pay, loss of job, disciplinary action,
demotion, suspension, accidents at work and decreased work efficiency.
Following are the measures to be taken in this regard;
i. Compulsory interventions at workplaces in both the organized and
unorganized sectors in identifying /screening, and treating the
Harmful Drinkersas the majority of the Harmful Drinkers start their
drinking early in the morning which in turn has shown an impact on
the work performance and productivity.
ii. Initiation of peer and workplace based intervention programmes for
behaviour change as majority initiated the drink with peers and peer
pressure maintains the drinking behaviour to a great extent.
iii. Integration of mental health screening with workplace interventions
and de-addiction treatment.
iv. Preparation and maintenance of appropriate referral directory for
effective mental health care.
v. Conduct of research studies on mental health status of Harmful
Drinkers for evolving suitable mental health strategies sincehigher
levels of mental health problems are found among Harmful Drinkers.
4. Revision of Curriculum in Schools/Colleges
Adolescence is a crucial period where the children learn all the positive and
negative traits on account of their socialization with their peers and
neighbourhood groups. School is an important socializing agency and the
curriculum followed here is very vital for the formation of their character and
183"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:198","behaviour. Since, alcoholism among the student community is slowly emerging
a revision in the school/college curriculum incorporating the following topics is
of utmost importance.
 Incorporate a module on the impact of alcoholism as the majority of the
Adolescents in the sample reported of initiating drinking at the age of
below 15 years or 15-21 years.
 Include the topics viz; individual/group counselling and yoga as the
majority of the Adolescents in the study cited; Family/Social problems
and resultant stresses and strains as the major reasons for their initiation /
continuance of drinking. This would facilitate the teachers understand the
initiation/continuance of drinking by the students and prepare them to
cope up with the problematic situations.
 Introduce Life skills education in the curriculum for equipping the
students with skills essential for a better living.
 Organise awareness classes for parents by the school authorities viz; PTA,
HM etc. for preventing them from being a negative role model and for
conscientizing them to observe the peer group and their activities closely.
5. Other Significant Recommendations
Other significant recommendations are scripted under the following heads viz;
Treatment related, Law related and Media related.
Treatment Related
 Set up more treatment centres for de-addiction.
 Initiate tobacco cessation programmes along with de-addiction treatment
as tobacco is found to be the other major addictive substance used by the
Alcohol Users other than drinking followed by Gunja/Charas/Sniffing
(correction fluid /whitener /kerosene).
 Start a cell at hospitals/clinics/PHCs for providing consideration services
to patients with alcohol use disorders asHarmful drinking is found to be
associated with multiple health concerns.
184"
"Impact of Alcoholism – Kerala.pdf,page:199"," Include family interventions with de-addiction treatment in order to
strengthen the family bonding and to enhance the family‟s involvement in
the treatment process for speeding up the recovery (abstinence) process as
most of the Harmful Drinkers had a significant impact on personal and
family functioning.
 Keep a track record of all alcoholic patients treated at the De-addiction
Centres and conduct strict follow up of their treatment and status quo.
 Utilize experiences of ex-addicts/members of AA (Alcoholic Anonymous)
for community based sensitization/awareness programmes as the Harmful
Drinkers under study were less aware of and had a low attitude towards
De-addiction treatment.
 Promote measures for networking and linkages with all govt. departments
viz; social welfare, health and labour, in order to identify, treat and
rehabilitate the alcoholics.
Law Related
 Strictly enforce the law related to the age of buying liquor (21years).
 Strengthen enforcement of law to address conflicts and violation of laws
due to harmful use of alcohol as physical fights and drunken driving
were reported more among the Harmful Drinkers.
Media Interventions
 Utilize the Services of Celebrities and Role models to advertise the
harmful effects of alcohol consumption.

in2016,andtoexaminevariationsinthealcohol-attributableburdenovertime,byglobal
burdenofdisease(GBD)region,age,andsex.
2.MaterialsandMethods
Acomparativeriskassessmentmethodologywasutilizedtoestimatetheburdenof
diseaseattributabletoalcoholusein2016.Theseestimationswerebasedonthetheoretical
minimumriskexposurelevel(TMREL)oflifetimeabstention.Lifetimeabstentionwasuti-
lizedasaTMRELbasedonhistoricalprecedent,andtheobservationthatlifetimeabstainers
mayhavethelowestriskofoverallhealthloss[10].Thepopulation-attributablefraction
(PAF)foralcoholusewasestimatedbasedonaLevin-basedmethodwhichcombinesdata
onalcoholexposurewithcorrespondingrelativerisk(RR)estimates[11,12].Information
regardingthemethodsutilizedandthedatasourcescanbefoundintheSupplemental
MaterialandinthepaperbyShieldetal.[1].
2.1.RelativeRiskEstimates
AlcoholRRestimatesforchronicdiseaseoutcomes(exceptfromischemicdiseases)
wereobtainedfrommeta-analysesandbasedonaveragedrinking(ingramsperday)[13].
Thelagtimebetweenalcoholuseanddiseaseoccurrencewasonlymodelledforcancer
(basedontheestimatethatthereisa10yearperiodbetweenexposureanddiseaseout-
comes[14]).Heavyepisodicdrinking(HED)wasutilizedinthemodellingfortheRRsfor
ischemicdiseasesandinjuries[1].AllRRestimateswerereviewedandapprovedbythe
WHOTechnicalAdvisoryGrouponAlcoholandDrugEpidemiology.ThesourcesofRR
estimatesareoutlinedinSupplementalMaterialTableS1.
2.2.Mortality,Morbidity,andPopulationData
Dataonmortality,YearsofLifeLost(YLL),morbiditymeasuredusingYearsLived
withDisability(YLD),age,sex,country,year,andbycauseofmortalityand/ormorbidity
wereobtainedfromtheWHO’sGlobalHealthEstimates[15].Thetotalburdenofdisease
wasmeasuredusingDisabilityAdjustedLifeYears(DALYs)lost.Estimatesofpremature
mortalitywerebasedonacutoffofdeathswhichoccurredamongpeople69yearsofage
andyounger[4,16].
Alcoholiccardiomyopathydeaths,YLL,andYLDwereestimatedusingthemethods
ofMantheyandcolleagues[17]astheywerenotdirectlyestimatedintheWHO’sGlobal
HealthEstimates.TheWHO’sroadtrafficdeathdatabase[18]wasusedtodeterminethe
fractionsofalcohol-attributablemotorvehicledeathswhichinvolvedadriverandthose

Populationdatabyage,sex,country,andyearwereobtainedfromtheUNPopulation
Division[19]. Deaths,YLLs,YLDs,andDALYslostwereaggregatedintofive-yearage

(seeFigureS1intheSupplementaryMaterialsforHDIgroupings).HDIcategorieswere
obtainedfromtheUnitedNationsDevelopmentProgramme[20]. TheHDIisbasedon
havingalongandhealthylife(i.e.,lifeexpectancyatbirth),beingknowledgeable(i.e.,
expectedyearsofschoolingandmeanyearsofschoolingforadults25yearsofageand
older),andhavingadecentstandardofliving(i.e.,GrossNationalIncomepercapita)[20].
The95%uncertaintyintervals(seeTablesS2–S14inSupplementaryMaterials)were
basedonasetof1000simulationsofalllowestlevelparameters(i.e.,parameterssampled
fromtheirrespectiveerrordistributions). Theseparameterswerethenusedtoestimate
1000simulatedestimatesofthealcohol-attributableburdenofdisease.Fromthesesimula-
tions,the2.5thand97.5thpercentileswereutilizedforthe95%uncertaintyintervals.
AnalyseswereperformedusingthestatisticalsoftwarepackageR[21].
3.Results
In2016,therewere2.0millionprematuredeathsand117.2millionDALYslostglobally
duetoalcoholuse,representing7.1%ofallprematuredeathsand5.5%ofallDALYslost
inthatyear(seeTables1and2). Incontrast,3.2%ofalldeathsand3.0%ofallDALYs
lostamongpeople70yearsofageandolderwereattributabletoalcoholconsumption.
Anestimated70.7%ofallalcohol-attributabledeathsand89.2%ofallalcohol-attributable
DALYslostgloballyin2016werepremature,i.e.,amongthose69yearsofageandyounger.
Incomparison,52.0%ofalldeathsand81.8%ofallDALYslostgloballyin2016were
premature. The alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs lost among those 69 years of
ageandyoungerweregreateramongmen(1.6milliondeathsand90.9millionDALYs
lost)comparedtowomen(0.5milliondeathsand26.3millionDALYslost). Thelargest
proportionofprematuredeathsthatwereattributabletoalcoholoccurredamongpeople
30–39yearsofage(13.3%)and20–29yearsofage(13.0%).SeeTablesS2toS17fordataon
sex-specificalcohol-attributabledeaths,YLL,YLD,andDALYslost.
The leading causes of the burden of premature alcohol-attributable deaths were
cirrhosisoftheliver(457,000deaths), roadinjuries(338,000deaths), andtuberculosis
(190,000deaths)(seeFigure1). Roadinjuriesandcirrhosisoftheliverweretheleading

Theresultsofthisstudyindicatethatalcohol-attributabledeathsandhealthloss
occurredamongpeoplerelativelyyounginage.Theproportionsofalcohol-attributable
deathsandDALYslostthatwereprematureweregreaterthantheproportionsofall-
causedeathsandDALYslostthatwereconsideredpremature. Thisindicatesthatal-
coholusedisproportionatelyaffectsthehealthofpeoplewhoareyoungerinage. The
causecompositionoftheprematurealcohol-attributableburdenisuniquewhencom-
paredtotheburdenamongpeople70yearsofageandolder,withcirrhosisoftheliver,
roadinjuries,andtuberculosisbeingtheprimarycontributorstothisburden. Further-

maturealcohol-attributableburdenofdiseaseandthecausecompositionofthisburden
wereobserved.
Thisstudymodelledboththedetrimentalandprotectiveeffectsofalcoholconsump-
tiononhealth.Specifically,alcoholconsumedatlowamounts,andnotonHEDoccasions

hasaprotectiveeffectondiabetes,ischemicheartdisease,andischemicstroke[13].This
studyfoundthatfortheprematurediseaseburden,thedetrimentaleffectsofalcoholatthe
populationleveloutweighedtheprotectiveeffects.Attheindividuallevel,theneteffect
ofalcoholconsumptiononoverallhealthisunknown;however,arecentmodellingstudy
foundnolevelofalcoholconsumptionthatprovidedanethealthbenefit[10].
Theprematureburdenofdiseaseattributabletoalcoholconsumptionwascharac-
terizedbytuberculosis,livercirrhosis,andinjuries. Livercirrhosisismainlylinkedto
theoverallvolumeofdrinking,whileinjuriesattributabletoalcoholaremostlyrelated
tointoxication(i.e.,bingealcoholconsumption)[13].Tuberculosisrisk(i.e.,theimpactof
alcoholontheimmunesystem)isrelatedbothtotheoverallvolumeofalcoholconsumed
andbingedrinking; however,duetothelackofstudies,theimpactofalcoholuseon
tuberculosiswasmodelledbasedonlyontheoverallvolumeofalcoholconsumed[13].
Therefore,bothoverallvolumeofalcoholconsumedanddrinkingtointoxicationarefactors
leadingtotheprematureburdenofdiseaseattributabletoalcoholconsumption.
Tuberculosisremainsanenormouspublichealthconcernglobally,especiallyinlow
andmediumHDIcountries[22].Thetreatmentoftuberculosisandtheinteractionbetween
HIV/AIDSandtuberculosisarekeypublichealthpriorities[23].Alcoholuseisakeyrisk

mentalhealthconcernshavebeenoverlookedintermsofpublichealthprogramming,
especiallyinyoungpeople[10]whereinjuriesandneuropsychiatricconditionsaregreatly

Theburdenofprematurediseaseattributabletoalcoholconsumptionwashighestin
EasternEurope,CentralEurope,andWesternsub-SaharanAfrica.TheCentralandEastern
Europeregionhaveahighoverallvolumeofalcoholconsumptionandahighprevalence

decreasesinavailability,havebeenimplementedintheEasternEuroperegionandhave
resultedinmarkeddownwardshiftsinmortalityandtheburdenofdisease[25].TheWest-
ernsub-SaharanAfricaregionhasarelativelylowoverallvolumeofalcoholconsumption.
Theburdenofalcohol-attributableprematurediseaseinthisregionwasdrivenmainlyby
infectiousdiseases,livercirrhosis,andinjuries. Cirrhosis-relateddeathsdoubledinthe
sub-SaharanAfricaregionbetween1980and2010,withhepatitisBvirus,hepatitisCvirus,
andalcoholusebeingcontributingfactorstothisincrease[26]. Furthermore,treatment
oflivercirrhosisisunavailableinmostpartsofsub-SaharanAfrica,duetoashortageof
hepatologistsandgastroenterologists,interventionalradiologists,hepatobiliarysurgeons,
andpathologists[27].
4.1.Limitations
Themethodsusedinthispaperarelimitedbyseveralfactors. Firstly, estimates
ofalcoholconsumptioncamefromsurveyswhicharesusceptibletonumerousbiases
whichleadtoanunderestimationofalcoholuse. Percapitaconsumptionofalcoholis
utilizedtoestimatethevolumeofalcoholuseamongdrinkerstoavoidbias;however,
nocorrectionexistsfortheprevalenceofHED.Thisstudydidnotfullyaccountforthe
interactionbetweenalcoholuseandotherriskfactors,suchassmoking(increasedriskof

Thisstudyisalsolimitedasdeathsandhealthlossduetointerpersonalharmare
basedonthealcoholconsumptionofthepersonwhoexperiencestheharmandnotthe
alcoholconsumptionofthepersonwhoinflictstheharm.Thisisduetotherelativerisks
ofinjuriesfromassaultbeingbasedonthepersonwhoexperiencestheharmandnot
thepersonwhoisinflictingtheharm[13]. Therefore,estimatesofintentionalharmare
likelyunderestimatedforchildrenandwomenwhoareoftenvictimsofalcohol-related
violence[31].Itisimportanttonotethatviolenceagainstwomenandchildrenisamajor
publichealth,socialpolicy,andhumanrightsconcernthatspansdisciplinesandgeographical
boundaries[32–35].Globally,domesticviolenceisoneofthelargestsourcesofnon-fatal
injuriestowomenandchildren[36],resultinginavoidableinequitiesinhealthstatus,and
increasesintheriskofmentalhealthandphysicalconditions[37].
4.2.HealthPolicies
Thehealthharmsandinequitiesoutlinedinthepapershouldbeconsideredinthe
contextofpopulation-levelinterventionswhichcanreducethealcohol-attributableburden
of disease and are sustainable, scalable, and politically, economically, and technically
feasible[38]. Severalalcoholinterventionshavebeendesignatedas“bestbuys”bythe
WHOastheyaremorecost-effectivethanmostotherinterventionsdesignedforother
riskfactors[39]. Theseincludeincreasesintaxationandrestrictionsonavailabilityand
marketing.OtherpoliciesincludeWHOcost-effective“verygoodbuys,”suchasenactment
andenforcementofimpaired-drivinglawsandblood-alcohol-concentrationlimits[39,40].
Theneedtointervenetoreducetheburdenofprematurehealthlossattributable
toalcoholconsumptioncanbeviewedundertheframeworkofutilitarianageism. The
frameworkofutilitarianageism,whichisoftenobservedinmedicalpractice,statesthat
thereshouldbeprioritizationoftreatmentsandinterventionsforhealthlossamongthe
young(astheoldhavelivedlonger)[41,42].
Despitethemajorityoftheburdenofdiseaseattributabletoalcoholconsumption
occurringamongpeople0to69yearsofage,alcoholleadstoasubstantialburdenof
diseaseamongpeople70yearsofageandolder.InterventionssuchastheWHObestbuys
andverybestbuysshouldalsobeprioritizedtoreducetheburdenamongpeople70years

regardlessofwhethertheethanolisconsumedintheformofbeer,wine,orspirits(with
theexceptionofalcoholpoisoningswhicharecausedpredominatelybytheconsumption
ofspirits)[13].

Socioeconomicstatusandwealth(SES):Epidemiologicstudiesusingavarietyofindi-

someindicationsthatthedose–responserelationshipsaresteeperatlowerlevelsofSES.
Forinstance,theRRofalcoholconsumptionforthosewithHIVinfectionswasconsider-

Evenseeminglysimplequestionssuchasthoseregardinglifetimeabstentionmayintroduce
somebiases[23]:inanationallyrepresentativeUSsurveywithfollow-up,morethanhalf

underestimationofthetruerelationship). Finally,inmanycasesriskcurvesarebased
onafewstudiesfromsimilarcultures.Thiscertainlyintroducesbias,andalsolimitsthe
generalizabilityofourknowledgewithrespecttogroups,definedbysex,age,orother
modifiers. Moreover,manyofthemedicalcohortswereselectedfortheirlikelihoodof

5.Conclusions
Dose–responserelationshipsarecrucialfordeterminingthebestmedicalrecommen-
dations (such as low-risk drinking guidelines; [77]) and for creating effective alcohol
controlpolicymeasures.Moreresearchisnecessarytobetterunderstandtheirvariability
anddeterminants.

2.9.ConfirmingtheCausalRelationReportedinObservationalStudies
Manyobservationalstudieshavebeenconductedtoidentifyanddefinetherisksfrom
drinkingalcoholandcancerdevelopment. Somelimitationsinthesestudieshavebeen
identified,suchaslackofsufficientadjustmentofconfoundingfactors,forexampletobacco
smokingandalcoholconsumptionarebothcommonriskfactorsfororalcavitycancer.
Therearealsoconcernsaroundreversecausality,withthereferencecategoriesofalcohol
non-drinkerspossiblyincludingformerdrinkerswhostillhaveanelevatedriskofcancer.
Thereareotherconcernsovertheaccuracyofrecordingofalcoholexposuredatawhere
biasmaybeincorporatedthroughnon-participationofheavydrinkersinhealthstudies,
andunder-reportingofalcoholconsumptionbythestudysubjects.
Onemethodwhichmightovercomesomeofthelimitationsinobservationalstudies
isMendelianrandomisation(MR),whichusesgeneticvariantstoexplorethecausalrela-
tionshipbetweenexposureanddiseaseoutcome.Assumingthatanalysesareconducted
appropriately,duetotherandomdistributionofthesegeneticvariantsatbirth,MRstudies
shouldbelesspronetoconventionalconfoundingandreversecausality.
Fororalandoropharyngealcancer,anMRstudyusinggeneticdataon6000oralor
oropharyngealcancercasesand6600controlsfoundapositivecausaleffectofalcohol
consumptionindependentofsmoking[16].Theauthorsconcludedthatpreviousestimates
oftheassociationbetweenalcoholandoralandoropharyngealcancerfromobservational
studiesmayhavebeenunderestimated[16].AnotherMRstudyonUKBiobankdatafound
thatdrinkingalcohol,especiallyabovetheUK’slow-riskguidelineofupto14unitsper

MRanalysisbyOngandcolleaguesfoundnosignificantincreaseinbreastcancerriskper
geneticallypredicteddrinkperday(oddsratio1.00(95%CI0.93–1.08))[19].
ThefuturepotentialofMRstudiesisyettobediscoveredbutdisclosingpotential
sourcesofbiasesandconfoundinginobservationalstudiesisnecessarytoobtainrobust
estimatesofthecausalrelationshipbetweenalcoholconsumptionandcancerrisk.
3.MechanismsofAlcohol-DrivenCarcinogenesis
Followingepidemiologicalevidenceofthelinkbetweenalcoholuseandriskofcancer
atmultiplesites,severalpathwayshavebeeninvestigatedtoexplainthecarcinogenic
effectsofalcohol.Here,wediscussthekeymechanismslinkingalcoholconsumptionto
carcinogenesis,whicharedepictedinFigure4.
3.1.ProductionofAcetaldehyde
Onceconsumed,alcoholismetabolisedbyenzymesincludingalcoholdehydroge-
nase(ADH),cytochromeP-4502E1(CYP2E1)andbacterialcatalase,producingacetalde-
hyde[20].AcetaldehydeishighlyreactivetowardsDNAandhasseveralcarcinogenicand
genotoxicproperties.
AsitishighlyreactivetowardsDNA,acetaldehydemaybindtoDNAtoformDNA
adductswhichalteritsphysicalshapeandpotentiallyblockDNAsynthesisandrepair[21].
TheseDNAadductsareparticularlygenotoxicastheycaninduceDNApointmutations,

double-strand breaks, sister chromatid exchanges, and structural changes to chromo-
(cid:3)
somes[21,22].TheDNAadductsinquestionincludeN2-ethylidene-2-deoxyguanosine,
(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3)
N2-ethyl-2-deoxyguanosine,N2-propano-2-deoxyguanosine(PdG),andN2-etheno-2-
deoxyguanosine[23].ThePdGadductmayformadditionalhighlygenotoxicstructures
suchasDNA-proteincross-linksandDNAinterstrandcross-linkswhichmayconfercar-
cinogenesis[24]. AswellasDNA-proteincross-links, acetaldehydemayalsobindto
proteinsdirectlycausingstructuralandfunctionalchanges[21];theseproteinsinclude
glutathione,aproteininvolvedinreducingoxidativestresscausedbyalcohol,andenzymes
whichcontributetoDNArepairandmethylation,amongothers.
Figure4.Asimplificationofthepathwaysbywhichalcohol,asethanol,mightdrivecarcinogenesis.Theenzymesalcohol

dehydrogenase(ALDH)enzymesthenmetaboliseacetaldehydetoacetatebutcommonpolymorphismscanreduceALDH
activity. AcetaldehydeformsDNAadductscausingmutationsandblockingDNAsynthesisandrepair. Bothethanol
andacetaldehydecandisruptDNAmethylationbyinhibitingS-adenosyl-L-methionine(SAMe)synthesisandDNA
methyltransferase(DNMT)activity,andethanolcanimpairone-carbonmetabolism. CytochromeP-4502E1(CYP2E1)
activityproducesreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS)leadingtolipidperoxidation,metastasis,angiogenesis,andfurther
formationofDNAadducts.EthanolcanalsoinduceinflammationleadingtoproductionofROSandtheirdownstream
effects.Retinoidmetabolismandthenormalfunctionoftheimmunesystemarebothimpairedbyethanol,whileethanol
mayleadtoincreasesinsexhormonelevels,aswellasdysbiosisofthemicrobiomeandlivercirrhosis.
BothacetaldehydeandethanolcanimpactDNAmethylationwhichmayleadto
changesintheexpressionofoncogenesandtumour-suppressorgenes[21].Acetaldehyde
caninhibittheactivityofDNAmethyltransferase(DNMT)whichisessentialfornormal
DNAmethylation; acetaldehydecanalsoreduceDNMTmRNAlevelsleadingtoless
productionofDNMT[25]. Acetaldehydeandethanolmayalsoinhibitthesynthesisof
S-adenosyl-L-methionine(SAMe)whichisessentialtoDNAmethylation[21].
Acetaldehydeisnottheend-productofethanolmetabolism,however,asundernormal
conditions,acetaldehydedehydrogenase(ALDH)enzymesconvertacetaldehydetoacetate.
ThegroupofALDHenzymescontainsALDH1A1,ALDH2,andALDH1B1,withALDH2

3.2.InductionofOxidativeStress
Ethanolcanalsocontributetocarcinogenesisthroughtheinductionofoxidativestress
whichisrecognisedasakeydeterminantofdiseaseinitiation[26]. Oxidativestresscan
beinducedbyactivationofcertainpathwayswhichproducereactiveoxygenspecies
(ROS)suchassuperoxideanionandhydrogenperoxide.Onepathwaybywhichethanol
achievesthisisthroughincreasedCYP2E1activitywhichproduceshighquantitiesof
ROSwhilstoxidisingethanoltoacetaldehyde[27].Heavyalcoholusehasbeenshownto
increaseCYP2E1expressionintheoesophagus[27].OthersourcesofROSduringethanol

AsROSarehighlyreactive,theirpresencecanleadtolipidperoxidationproducing
aldehydeswhichcanbindtoDNAformingetheno-DNAadducts[29,30].Theseethe-DNA

alcohol-drivenpromotionandprogressionofHCC[32].
3.3.IncreasedInflammation
Inflammationisakeypathwaytocancerprogressionatseveralsitesandisenhanced
byalcoholuse.Chronicalcoholconsumptioncanrecruitspecificwhitebloodcells(mono-
cytesandmacrophages)tothetumourmicroenvironment.Thesewhitebloodcellsproduce
pro-inflammatorycytokines,suchastumournecrosisfactorα(TNF-α)andtheinterleukins
IL-1,IL-6,andIL-8[31,33],whichactivateoxidant-generatingenzymesleadingtodown-
streamformationofROS[30]. NF-κBisalsoactivatedbythesecytokines,stimulating
furtherROS-producingenzymes.

drinkersmayattenuatetheincreasedriskoflivercancermortalitycomparedwiththose
withlowfolateintake[36].Thisattenuationwasalsoobservedforriskofpostmenopausal
breastcanceramongwomenwhodrinkalcoholandhavehigherfolatelevels[37]. The
effectofalcoholonone-carbonmetabolismandfolatemightalsobeimportantincolorectal
cancerdevelopment[20].
3.5.AlteredRetinoidMetabolism
Retinoidsareimportantregulatorsagainstcarcinogenesisastheycaninducecell
growth,celldifferentiation,andapoptosis[31].Alcoholcanalterretinoidmetabolismby
inhibitingtheoxidationofvitaminAtoretinoicacid[21].AlcoholincreasesCYP2E1activity
(Section3.2)whichalsofunctionstometaboliseretinoicacidresultingintheproductionof
toxicmetabolites[21].Thisincreasedtoxicityofretinoidsmayexplaintheobservationof

headandneckcancers[31].Retinoidsmayalsoplayaroleinothersignallingpathways
implicatedincancerdevelopment,suchasoestrogenandbreastcancer[31].
3.6.ChangestoOestrogenRegulation
Alcoholmightinterferewithoestrogenpathwaysbyincreasinghormonelevelsand
enhancingtheactivityofERs,importantinbreastcarcinogenesis[38].Sexhormonelevels
maybeincreasedbyalcoholthroughoxidativestressandthroughinhibitionofthesteroid
degradationenzymessulfotransferaseand2-hydroxylase[39].Heavyuseofalcoholhas
alsobeenlinkedwithincreasedcirculatinglevelsofoestroneandoestradiolaswellas
dehydroepiandrosteronesulphate(DHEAS)[39].DHEASismetabolisedtooestrogenby
aromatase,theactivityofwhichisalsoincreasedinchronicalcoholconsumers[40]. A
largecohortstudyfoundDHEASlevels25%higheramongwomenconsumingatleast
20galcoholperdaycomparedwithnon-drinkers[41].However,someoftheassociations
amongalcoholdrinkingpremenopausalwomenwerelimitedtothosetakingoralcontra-
ceptives[40]. Despitelimitedevidenceofmediationoftheassociationbetweenalcohol
andbreastcancerbyindividualsexhormones,acase-controlstudynestedwithinEPIC
foundthatahormonalsignaturereflectinglowerlevelsofsex-hormonebindingglobulin
andhigherlevelsofsexhormonesmediated24%oftheassociation,suggestingthatan
interplayofhormonesmaycontributetoalcohol-mediatedbreastcancerdevelopment[42].
ERsareimportanttranscriptionfactorswithincellsandmayprovidethemainpath-
waybywhichalcoholpromotesbreasttumourgrowth[40]. Elevatedconcentrationsof
oestrogenduetoalcoholusemayleadtoincreasedtranscriptionalactivityofER(upto
15timeshigherthannormalactivity),resultinginproliferationofER+cells[39].
3.7.ReducedFunctionoftheImmuneSystem
Alcoholhasmultiplenegativeeffectsonthehostimmunesystem.Firstly,alcoholcan

cancerouscells[33].AlcoholcanblockNKcellsfrombeingreleasedfromthebonemar-
row[31].AlcoholcanalsoactivateNKTcellswhichareassociatedwithliverinjuryand
hepatocyteapoptosis[33].Additionally,alcoholmaysuppressTcellimmuneresponses
thereforedecreasingtheanti-tumourregulationoftheimmunesystem.
Withtheimmunesystembeingcompromised,alcoholconsumptioncanexacerbate
damagefromviralinfectionssuchashepatitisCvirus,whichiscommonamongchronic
alcoholicliverdiseasepatients[43]. Inaddition,heavyepisodicalcoholusemightre-
ducetheimmunesystem’sdefenceagainstinfectionbydisruptingtheproductionofpro-
inflammatorycytokinesandincreasingtheexpressionofanti-inflammatorycytokines[33].
Thisiscontrarytotheincreasedexpressionofpro-inflammatorycytokinesduetochronic
alcohol exposure as discussed with other evidence on alcohol-induced inflammation
(Section3.3).
3.8.DysbiosisoftheMicrobiome
Microbiota in the oral cavity metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde by the enzyme
catalase. However, these bacteria have limited capacity to break acetaldehyde down
furtherintoitsnon-harmfulcompoundacetate,thustheoralepitheliaarefurtherexposed
toacetaldehyde[21,44].Acetaldehydeconcentrationsinthesalivaofdrinkersarebetween
10and100timeshigherthanintheblood;thisisfurtherdoubledinsmokerswhodrink
alcoholastobaccosmokecontainshighlevelsofacetaldehyde[21].
Increasedethanolconsumptioncaninducemicrobialdysbiosisandbacterialover-
growthintheintestine[20]. Thisheightenedbacterialpresencemaycompromisethe
intestinal barrier resulting in ”gut leakiness” where the permeability of the intestinal
lumenishighenoughsuchthatbacterialproductsincludinglipopolysaccharidesand
peptidoglycanmovefromtheintestineintotheblood[20,45]. Onceinthebloodthese
bacterialproductseasilyreachtheliverwhereavarietyofcellsareactivated(endothelial
cells,livermacrophages,stellatecellsandhepatocytes)producingachronicinflammatory
environment[33],whichmayconferanincreasedriskoflivercancer[46].
3.9.LiverCirrhosis

alcoholexposureisassociatedwithreducedexpressionofthecytokineinterferon-γwhichis
aninhibitorofliverfibrosis[33].Furthermore,ROS(Section3.2)maytriggertheproduction
ofpro-fibroticcytokinesandcollageninlivercells[28].
3.10.ActivationofOtherCarcinogens
Thereisfurtherhypothesisthatalcoholconsumptionmightactivatethepathwaysof
othercarcinogenicagents;thiscouldoccurthroughthealcohol-inducedactivityofCYP2E1
whichmaymetabolisepro-carcinogensintobaccosmokeandindustrialchemicals[21].It

wine,beer,spirits,andunrecordedalcohol,lowerformaldehydecontamination(1.8percent)

unlikely.
Acrylamide, considered by IARC as probably carcinogenic, may produce cancer
throughitsmetabolite,glycidamide,thatformsDNAadducts[9]. Nevertheless,there
are only a few reports on the occurrence of acrylamide in alcoholic beverages with
onestudyreportingacrylamidelevelsof22μg/kg[10]. Thegroup2Bcarcinogen, 3-

In 2015, IARC classified the controversial herbicide glyphosate as “probably car-
cinogenic to humans” based on some evidence in humans due to a correlation with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and significant evidence for glyphosate’s carcinogenicity in
experimentalanimals[40].In2013,Nagatomietal.observedthatglyphosatecontentin

Fromariskassessmentstandpoint,theseobservedamountsareunlikelytocauseharm.
Ethyl carbamate, a probable human carcinogen (group 2A) [42], has been found
in small concentrations in wines and beers (in μg/L) [43] and in larger proportions
in stone-fruit spirits (in mg/L) [43]. Another group 2A carcinogenic compound, N-
nitrosodimethylamine(NDMA),ishepatotoxic[27].Ethanolthroughitssolvationeffect

Muchofthecalorificintakeofindividualswithalcoholismcomesfromtheircon-

Notably,Acetaldehydecontributestotoxiceffectsofchronicalcoholonthebrainleading

3.5.Conclusion
fMRIstudieshaveallowedustoidentifytheeffectsofalcoholuseanddependence
onbrainfunctionaswellasvulnerabilitytoheavyuse. Typically,exposuretoalcohol
sensitizestherewardsystemtoalcoholrelatedcues, interfereswiththeprocessingof
non-drugreward,increasesimpulsivity,anddisruptsemotionalregulation. However,
thefindingsdiscussedherealsohighlightthevariabilityofindividualdifferencesinthe
presenceandmagnitudeofsuchneurocognitivedeficitswhichmaybedrivenbyexposure,
traitfactorsorabstinence.Finally,animportantcaveattomuchofthepresentevidence
isthegeneralizabilityofsmallcohortcross-sectionalstudies.Tobettercharacterizebrain
function and behavior following exposure to alcohol both acute and chronic, as well
as improve treatment outcome and reduce risk of relapse, it is imperative that large-
scalestudieswithlongitudinaldesignsareconducted. Thisinformationiscriticalfor
developmentofalcoholregulationandabuseprevention.

4.3.Opioids
Theopioidsystemisacutelyinvolvedinthereinforcingeffectsofalcohol. Theμ-

Manycountriesprovideinformationtohealthcarepractitionersandthepublicre-

alcoholusecansubstantiallyincreasetheriskofFASD[21].Despitethesepublichealth
efforts,approximately10%ofwomenworldwidecontinuetoconsumealcoholduring
pregnancy[22,23].
TheWHOEuropeanRegion(EUR)wasestimatedtohavethehighestprevalenceof
alcoholuseduringpregnancy(25.2%)[22](seeTable2).Thisisnotsurprising;according
tothelatestGlobalStatusReportonAlcoholandHealth[4],theEuropeanRegionranked
highestinnearlyallmajoralcoholindicators,includingprevalenceofconsumption,levels
ofconsumption,ratesofalcoholuse,HED,andAlcoholUseDisorders(AUDs).

2.1.FetalAlcoholSpectrumDisorder
ThemostdramaticmanifestationofPAEisFetalAlcoholSpectrumDisorder(FASD).
FASDdescribesawiderangeofeffects,thesearebroadlyclusteredintothreecategories:
(1)cognitiveimpairmentsincludingcentralnervoussystemdamage,congenitalanomalies,
prenatalorpostnatalgrowthrestrictions;(2)characteristicdysmorphicfacialfeatures;and
(3)deficitsincognitive,behavioral,emotional,andadaptivefunctioning.Sincethefirst
descriptionofFASbyJonesandSmithin1973[63,64],theterminologyandthediagnostic
guidelineshavechangednumeroustimes.Dependingontheclassificationsystem,FASD
includesseveralalcohol-relateddiagnoses,suchasFetalAlcoholSyndrome(FAS),partial
FAS(pFAS),alcohol-relatedneurodevelopmentaldisorder(ARND),andAlcohol-Related
Birth Defects (ARBD) [65,66]. The Canadian framework utilizes a single designation
ofFASDasadiagnosticterm,withthespecificationofthepresenceorabsenceofthe
characteristicsentinelfacialfeatures[67].Inaddition,thecategoryofneurodevelopmental
disorderassociatedwithprenatalalcoholexposure(ND-PAE)isincludedintheDiagnostic
andStatisticalManualofMentalDisorders,FifthEdition(DSM-5;[68]). Althoughthe
criteriaforFASDdiagnoseshavebeendescribedthoroughly,thediagnosisofFASDremains
challenging,andthespecificassessmenttechniquesusedtomakethedefinitivediagnosis
arestilldebated,especiallyforARND.ItisimportanttonotethatFASDcapturesonlya
modestproportionofdamagetothedevelopingfetusfromalcoholexposure,sonotevery
childwithPAEwillbediagnosedwithFASD[22].
TheriskofdevelopingFASDisrelatedtothepatterns(thequantity,frequency,du-
ration)ofalcoholconsumption,aswellasotherfactors. Ithasbeenwelldocumented
inbothanimalandhumanstudiesthatlargerquantitiesofPAEandsustaineddrinking
throughoutalltrimestersofpregnancyresultingreaterphysicalandcognitivedeficits,and
theappearanceoffacialfeaturesinFAS[69].Bingedrinkingisassociatedwiththehighest
riskoffetaldamage[52].However,manystudiesshowthatlowandmoderatedrinking
duringpregnancyisalsoassociatedwithfetaldamage[20,21].
Researchstudiesshowthatmanyotherriskfactorscanalsoinfluencedevelopment
ofFASD,whichincludeasmallerbodyprofileofmother(height,weight,andbodymass
index[BMI]),maternalage,lowsocioeconomicstatusandsmoking[52],apoornutritional
status(deficitofriboflavin,calcium,andzinc;[70],geneticpolymorphisms[71,72],and
paternalalcoholconsumption[73].
Several categories of biomarkers of PAE and FASD have been proposed. These
includebiomarkersdemonstratingadverseoutcomesforFetalAlcoholSyndromeinclud-
inganatomicalmarkers(e.g.,facialabnormalities;micrognathia);biomarkersofneuro-
logicalimpairments(e.g.,reducedmemoryretention),developmentalbiomarkers(e.g.,
delayedmotorlearning)andneurobehavioralbiomarkers(e.g.,deficitsinexecutivefunc-
tioning)[74]. Forexample,lowerserumconcentrationsofinsulingrowthfactorsIGF-I
andIGF-IIhavebeenfoundtobeareliablebiomarkerofprenatalalcoholexposurein
children[75].Certainimagingstudiesareproposedtobebiomarkersforbraindifferences
associatedwithFASD,includingtheuseofcomputerizedtomography,magneticresonance
imagingandpositronemissiontomography[74].Inaddition,anumberofbiomarkersfor
PAEpresentatbirthareavailablebasedonmeconiumandcordblood[74,76,77].
FASDhasaverybroadphenotypeandisfurthercomplicatedbyhighratesofco-

The complexity and chronicity of FASD affects both the affected individual and
their family. In many cases, peoplewith FASDrequire lifelong support from a wide
rangeofsupportservices,includinghealthcare,socialassistance,andremedialeducation.
Accordingly, ithasbeenshownthatFASDhasasubstantialeconomicimpactonany
society[79–81]. InCanada, theannualcostattributabletoFASDwasestimatedtobe

2.3.PrevalenceofFetalAlcoholSpectrumDisorder
Globally,theprevalenceratesofFASDamongthegeneralpopulationwereestimated
tobe77.3per10,000people[22,86].TheprevalenceofFASDinthegeneralpopulationwas
estimatedtobehighestintheEuropeanRegion,at198.2per10,000people,andlowestin
theEasternMediterraneanRegion,at1.3per10,000people(Table2;[22,86]),respectively.
These estimates are in line with the above-reported prevalence of alcohol use during
pregnancy.ThefivecountrieswithhighestprevalenceofFASDper1,000wereSouthAfrica
(111.1),Croatia(53.3),Ireland(47.5),Italy(45.0),andBelarus(36.6)[86].Thefivecountries
withthelowestprevalenceofFASD(<0.1per1,000)wereOman,UnitedArabEmirates,
SaudiArabia,Qatar,andKuwait[86].
Recentmulti-siteactivecaseascertainmentstudiesintheUnitedStateshaveestimated
theprevalenceofFASDtobe5%amongstudentsingradeone[21,87–89].InCanada,the
population-basedprevalenceofFASDamongelementaryschoolchildrenwasestimated
tobebetween2%and3%[90]. Thesestudiesfoundthatnearlyallofthesestudentsin

Asystematicreviewandmeta-analysisrevealedthatFASDprevalenceismuchhigher

instance,theprevalenceofFASDwas62%amongchildrenwithintellectualdisabilitiesin
careinChile[92],over52%amongadopteesfromEasternEurope[93],andapproximately
40%amongchildrenresidinginorphanagesinLithuania[94]. Thehighestprevalence
estimatesofFetalAlcoholSyndrome(FAS),whichrangedbetween46%and68%,were

AlcoholconsumptionandIHDarebothhighlyprevalentinhigh-incomecountries.

Nevertheless,bothmenandwomenwithalcoholusedisorders,whooftentimes,butnot
always,drinkveryheavily,havebeenassociatedwithsomeofthehighestmortalityrisks
forIHD(RR=1.62;95%CI:1.34to1.95inmen;RR=2.09;95%CI:1.28to3.41inwomen
comparedtothegeneralpopulation)[17].
Duetothelargeheterogeneityobservedinmeta-analysesofalcoholconsumptionand
CVDoutcomes,itisclearthatnotalldrinkingisassociatedwithalowerriskforIHD.For
example,datafromRussiaconsistentlyshowadetrimentalassociationwithIHDoutcomes;
however,itshouldbenotedthatthemostprevalentdrinkingpatterninRussiaatthetime

Bothdrinkingpatternswouldresultinthesamemagnitudeofaveragealcoholintakeover

Perhaps the most compelling observational evidence for a beneficial association
betweenaveragealcoholconsumptionandIHDcomesfromanindividual-participant
analysisofnearly600,000currentdrinkersoftheEmergingRiskFactorsCollaboration,
EPIC-CVD,andtheUKBiobankcohorts[28].Inaninverserelationship,thehazardratio

Thethreatofunmeasuredconfoundingvariablesandothersourcesofbias[7]isnot
uniquetothealcohol–IHDrelationship. Earlyon,thesick-quitterhypothesis[29]was
widelythoughttobethecauseoftheJ-shapedcurvereportedinmanystudies. Meta-
analyses have shown that former drinkers are associated with a higher risk for IHD
mortalitythanlifetimeorlong-termabstainers(RR=1.25;95%CI:1.15–1.36)[30]. No
associationwasfoundforbothsexesforIHDmorbidity.Thesick-quitterhypothesishas

tonegateanylowerriskforIHDfoundinpeoplewhodrinkupto30gonaverageperday
withoutheavydrinkingepisodes.Thus,theriskwassimilarforlifetimeabstainersand
peoplewhoconsumealcoholmostlyinheavydrinkingepisodes.However,theconceptof
heavyepisodicdrinking,atleastregardingtheCVDeffectsofalcoholconsumption,isnot
clearlydefined,anddifferentstudiesusedifferentthresholdsforheavyepisodicdrinking.

However,theuseofsuchanapproach[45,46],whichdependsonseveralassumptionsthat

3.Hypertension
Severalmeta-analyseshavebeenpublishedoverthelasttwodecadesthatsummarize
therelationshipbetweenaveragealcoholconsumptionandincidenceofhypertension[51,52,54–58].
Whileolderreviews(e.g.,[54,58])foundasmallbutsignificantlylowerriskinwomenwho

didnotfindsuchanassociation.Inparticular,inameta-analysisof361,254participants

possibleexplanationforthisdifferencecouldbemoredetrimentaldrinkingpatternsamong

4.Stroke
Therearetwomajorstrokesubtypeswithdifferingaetiologies:IS(basedonischaemic

tohigherprevalence,IStypicallydrivesinvestigationsoftotalstroke.Withsimilaritiesin

5.AFandCardiomyopathy
Severalmeta-analyseshaveinvestigatedtheriskofAFinrelationtoalcoholcon-
sumption[63–66].Inameta-analysisofsevencohortstudieswith12,554casesofAF,in
comparisontonon-drinkers,theriskforAFwaselevatedinalldrinkinggroups,even
whenheavyepisodicdrinkerswereexcludedfromtheanalysis. Thepooledlinearrisk

consumption. Morerecently,usingdatafrom249,496participants,ameta-analysiscon-
cludedthattherewasnoincreaseinriskforAFforconsumptionof6–7drinks(10–12g
perdrink)perweek[63].Anotherlargecohortstudyof403,281participantsfromtheUK
Biobankwith21,312incidentcasesofAFreportedaJ-shapedrelationshipforaverage

Whiletheexactamountsremainunknown,alcoholconsumption(eitherregularor
irregular), cancause, asidefromhypertension, structuraldamagetotheheartmuscle
and arrythmias [68]. Cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by ventricle dilatation,
hypertrophy,anddysfunction,canbecausedbyalcoholconsumptionanditsmetabolites,
bothofwhichhaveadirecttoxiceffectontheheartmuscles[68]. Aquantificationof
apotentialdose–responserelationshiphasnotbeenpossibletodate;however,itseems

cardiomyopathy,or,conversely,that23–47%ofpatientswithdilatedcardiomyopathyhave,
infact,alcoholiccardiomyopathy[69].
6.HeartFailure
CVDcategories,suchasIHD,hypertension,andcardiomyopathy,increasetherisk
of heart failure. Three meta-analyses largely came to similar conclusions [70–72]. In
themostrecentmeta-analysispublishedin2018,whichconsistedof355,804participants
with13,738casesofHFbasedon13cohortstudies,itwasshownthatthedose–response
relationshipbetweenalcoholconsumptionandHFwascurvilinear[71]. Comparedto
non-drinkers,theriskfor1–84gperweek,85–168gperweek,168–336gperweek,and
>336gperweekwereRR=0.86(95%CI:0.81–0.90),0.88(0.77–1.01),0.91(0.80–1.04),and

notjudgedtobenecessarilycausal,evenwhenalcoholusewasrelatedtotheincidence

2.1.AlcoholandHIVAcquisition/Transmission
2.1.1.BehavioralMechanisms
Most HIV seroconversions result from sexual activity [29], and alcohol has been
associatedwithadiminishedlikelihoodofengagementinthebehaviorsnecessaryto
preventsexuallybasedHIVacquisition/transmission.Consumingalcoholinsexualcon-
textscanresultinalcoholmyopia[30],whichentailsanalcohol-inducedconstraintin
cognitivecapacitythatcausesafocusonrisk-impellingcues(e.g.,sexualarousal)and
adisregardofrisk-inhibitingcues(e.g.,theprospectofHIVacquisition/transmission),
therebyincreasingthelikelihoodofcondomlesssex.Thismechanismandcorresponding

meta-analyses[7–12,14,31]aswellasthroughcontrolledexperimentsthathaveprovided
evidenceforthecausalnatureofthislink[16,17,32–34].
Morerecently,HIVpreventioneffortshaveemphasizedbiomedicalapproaches,which
includeHIVPre-ExposureProphylaxis(PrEP)—amedicationtakendailybythoseliving
withoutHIVtopreventHIVacquisition[35,36]; andTreatmentasPrevention(TasP)—
whichinvolvespeoplelivingwithHIVtakingantiretroviraltherapy(ART)toachieveviral
suppression,therebyeliminatingthepossibilityofviraltransmission[21–23].Despitetheir
biomedicalbasis,theseapproachesaredirectlyreliantonabehavior,namelyadherence,
whichhasbeenshowntobenegativelyassociatedwithalcoholuse[18–20,37–41].Avariety
ofunderlyingmechanismsforthisassociationhavebeenproposed,which,forthesake

possiblethatlong-actingformulationsofPrEPandARTmaybeparticularlywellsuited

2.1.2.BiologicalMechanisms
AlcoholusecanfacilitateHIVacquisition/transmissionby(1)decreasinghostimmune

peoplelivingwithHIV.Regardingtheformer,alcoholdisruptsthephysiologyoftheliver,

6.1.ReducingtheIncidenceofCommunicableDiseases
Individual-levelapproachesfocusingonalcoholreductioninordertoreducethe
incidenceofpneumoniaandTBarerelativelyrare, whereasmorestudiesfocusedon
alcoholusereductionforpreventingHIVtransmissionhavebeenconducted. Withina
systematicreviewofstudiesofinterventionsforreducingtheincidenceofTB,nostudies
that examined alcohol-reduction interventions for reducing the incidence of TB were
found[188].
Similarly,despitetheroleofalcoholuseinincreasingtheriskofpneumoniaacqui-
sition,alcoholusereductionseemstobemissingaspartofanumberoftextsproviding
recommendationsforthepreventionofpneumonia(e.g.,[189,190]). Ontheotherhand,
oneofthemainpreventativemeasuresforpneumoniaisvaccination,andcommentators
haverecommendedvaccinatingindividualswithanAUDinordertoprevent(re-)infection
withpneumonia[158].Others(e.g.,[191])havesuggestedthatcliniciansshouldidentify

Afewprimarystudiesthathaveevaluatedtheefficacyofindividual-levelalcohol

Alcoholcontrolpoliciesthatarealignedwiththethreealcohol“bestbuys”—increasing
excisetax,bansorrestrictionsonalcoholadvertising,andrestrictingtheavailabilityof
alcohol[205]—aremosteffectiveforreducingpopulation-levelalcoholuse.Thesemeasures
canbeexpectedtobeeffectiveforreducingtheincidenceofandmorbidityandmortality
duetoalcohol-attributableTB,pneumonia,andHIV.Thereissomeevidencethatmay
provide support for such effects. For example, a study in the United States showed
thatlongersaleshoursatthestate/districtlevelwereassociatedwithhigh-risksexual

3.1.AlcoholMetabolism
Themetabolismofalcoholintheliveriskeytounderstandingitsroleinthepathogen-
esisofalcohol-relatedliverdisease. Alcoholisprimarilymetabolisedinhepatocytesby
alcoholdehydrogenasetoacetaldehydeandthentoacetatebyaldehydedehydrogenase.
Acetateisconvertedtowaterandcarbondioxidemainlyinperipheraltissue,whichis
easilyexcreted.Aminorityofalcoholismetabolisedbythemitochondrialenzymeoxida-
tionsystem(MEOS),throughtheactionofthecytochromeP450(CYP)enzymeCYP2E1,to
acetaldehydewiththegenerationofROS.Athirdminorpathwayofalcoholmetabolismto

Alcoholisaknownneurotoxinandcentralnervoussystemdepressant.Evenatlowto
moderatelevels,alcoholhasbeenobservedtoimpairbalance,visualfocus,reactiontime,

Global burden of disease estimates indicate that as a proportion of total alcohol-
attributableinjuries,IVaccountsforabout16%ofdeathsand18%ofDALYs[1].However,
IV is highly prone to under-reporting in official statistics, often as a result of victims
avoidingauthoritiesorofficialagenciesforfearoffurthervictimisation.Inaddition,effects
ofIVcanextendwellbeyondimmediatephysicalconsequencesthatmightcompelavictim

3.4.Indiviudal-LevelMechanismsLinkingAlcoholandFoodIntake
3.4.1.Appetite,HungerandSatiety
It is proposed that alcohol stimulates appetite; a phenomenon referred to as the
aperitifeffect[48].However,severalstudiesexaminingtheeffectofalcoholonlevelsof
ghrelin(predominanthunger-stimulatinghormone),haveyieldedmixedfindings,with
someevenobservingareductioninghrelin[18,49]. Itisspeculatedthatalcoholmay

tenminutes[50].Comparedtothelemonadegroup,thealcoholgroupsexperiencedgreater
snackurgebetweenbaselineandtherestperiod,andexperiencedasmallerdeclinein

Aswithothernutritivebeverages,alcoholisproposedtoelicitweaksatietysignals

3.5.3.TheRoleofFoodandAlcoholIndustries
As corporate industries, ‘Big Food’ and ‘Big Alcohol’ use similar marketing and
lobbyingtacticswithhighdegreesofco-operation[85–88].Forexample,bothindustries
haveengagedintheuseof‘framing’;wherebyactorsusediscursivestrategiesto‘frame’a

Neitherexperimentalnorobservationalevidencesupportedaclearassociationbe-

physical(removingethanolfromregularbeer)approachesaremoresuitabletoachieve
thisgoal[21–27].Mostofthereviewsrefertoregulationswhendefiningbeerproducts;for
example,EUregulationsrequire0.5%alcoholbyvolume(ABV)orlessfornon-alcoholic

(2)whatistheimpactofthelabelsandkeylabelcharacteristicsonthestudiedoutcomes?
2.Methods
2.1.Design
Toanswertheresearchquestions,weusedscopingreviewmethodology,guidedby
themethodologicalframeworkofArkseyandO’Malley[47].Scopingreviewsareusedto
mapthemainconceptsintheresearchareaandpresentabroadoverviewoftheexisting
evidence,includingidentificationofthegaps,regardlessofthestudyquality[48]. The
protocolwasnotpublishedinadvance,andtheresultsarereportedinaccordancewith
PRISMA-ScRchecklist[49].
2.2.EligibilityCriteria
Tobeincludedinthereview,studieshadtoevaluateneworenhancedalcoholhealth
warninglabelsinanypopulation. By“new”,weconsideredlabelsdevelopedforthe
purposeoftheresearchandnotpreviouslyimplementedinpractice,andby“enhanced”,
we considered improved versions of existing labels already implemented in practice.
Studies had toinclude experimental or quasi-experimentalmethodology with clearly
delineatedindependentanddependentvariables,inordertobeabletosynthesiseresults
basedonthemanipulatedvariablesandtoidentifythekeycharacteristicsofeffective
labels. Onlypeer-reviewedarticlesintheEnglishlanguagepublishedin2010orafter
wereincluded,asinthepreviousreviews,therewerenoolderexperimentalstudiesof
newmessages. Studiesthatdidnotincludehealthwarningmessages,thatfocusedon
qualitativedataorwereonlycross-sectionalevaluationswereexcluded.
2.3.InformationSourcesandSearchStrategy
Fourdatabases(WebofScience,MEDLINE,PsycInfo,CINAHL)weresearchedwith
theabovementionedrestrictionsonlanguageanddates(Englishlanguage,January2010–
April2021). Additionally,wecomplementedthedatabasesearcheswithinspectionof
referencelistsofrelevantarticlesandreviews,andweundertookaGoogleScholarsearch.
Thesearchstrategycontainedacombinationoftermsrelatedtoalcohollabelling:[alcohol
AND(labelORlabel*)AND(messageORinformationORwarning)AND(experiment*
OReval*OReffect)].
2.4.StudySelectionandSummary
Studyselectionwasperformedbyoneresearcheraccordingtotheabovementioned
inclusionandexclusioncriteria,withambiguouscasesbeingresolvedthroughconsultation
withthesecondresearcher.Aftertheremovalofduplicates,thestudieswerefirstscreened
bytitleandabstract,followedbyfulltextexaminationandfinalarticleselection.Next,the
datawerechartedtoanswerthemainresearchquestions.Nexttogeneralinformationon
thepapers’aimandmethodology,informationonlabeldevelopmentandimplementation
wascharted,aswellastheindependentstudiedvariablesandtheresultsforeachofthe
outcomes.Papersratherthanstudiesweretakenastheunitsofinterest,asthefocusofthe

3.Results
Intotal,weidentified27papersthatfitourinclusioncriteria(seeAppendixAfor
PRISMAdiagram)[50–76]. Onepaperreportedontwostudiesusingdifferentmethod-
ologiestostudythesamevariables[50],andfourpapersreportedondifferentaspectsof

thirds(18)oftheincludedpaperswerepublishedin2018orlater,indicatinganincreasing
researchinterestinthetopic. AlloftheresearchwasundertakeninWesterncountries:
mostpapersreportedonresearchconductedintheUK(nine),Canada(six)andAustralia
(five).TheremainingpapersreportedonresearchconductedintheUS(three),Germany
(two)orweremulti-country(twiceLuxembourg/Germany,andonceItaly/France).Only
fourpapersdescribedreal-worldinterventions.Theremainderofthestudieswereeither
conductedonline(sixteen)orinalaboratory(eight,ofwhichonewasinanaturalistic

lowernumberofparticipantswereconductedinthelaboratoryandbefore2018,indicating
that inrecent years, largersample sizes wereaccessible in aneasier mannerthrough
onlinepanels. Two-thirdsofthepapersfocusedonthegeneraladult(oflegaldrinking
ageinthecountry)drinkingpopulation,althoughtheexactinclusioncriteriadifferedand
rangedfrompeopledrinkingatleastonceinthepast12months,topeopleconsuming
alcoholweekly.Eightofthepapersfocusedontheyoungerpopulation/students(some
byconvenienceratherthanbyinclusioncriteria)andonepaperfocusedonsecondary
schoolstudents.
3.1.ResearchScope
Toanswerthefirstresearchquestion,welookedattheaimofthepapersandthe
variablesstudied(bothindependentvariablesandtheoutcomes),aswellasatthecontent
andformatofthestudiedlabels.
Intermsofstudyaimsandstudiedindependentvariables,fivepapers(19%)compared
onlyneworenhancedlabelswithnoorregularlabels[51–54,63].Focusingonlabelcontent,
eightpapers(30%)comparedtext-onlylabelswithtextandimagelabels[55,56,61,62,64–67],
twelvestudies(44%)comparedtextmessagecharacteristics(e.g.,content,specificity,fram-
ing,source,useofcausallanguage)[57–60,67–74]andthree(11%)comparedimagechar-
acteristics[57,66,75]. Four(15%)paperscomparedlabelformats,suchassize,position,
colourorbranding[50,64,70,76].Additionally,ninepapers(33%)studiedothervariables,
suchasalcoholcontent,alcohol/substancetype,efficacyinformation,expectancyand
self-affirmation[64–66,68,69,73–76].
Themajorityofpapersinvestigatedmorethanoneoutcome(Table2). Themost
commonlystudiedoutcomeswereattitude(41%ofthepapers),intentions(30%),emotion-
relatedoutcomes(e.g.,fear,worry)(26%)andacceptability/supportforthelabels(26%).
Behaviourwasstudiedinsixpapers(22%)—inthreeofthemthroughself-report[51,54,67],
butalsothroughpurchasing[53,56]orconsumingalcohol[62].
Thetestedlabelswerepredominantlydevelopedbytheresearchersthemselves,based
eitheronotherresearch(e.g.,relatedtotobaccoandalcohollabels,alcoholharm,effective
messages)oronowndevelopmentandpiloting(e.g.,throughqualitativestudies),orboth.
Inthefourpapersrelatedtoareal-worldintervention[51–54],thelabelswereadditionally
(nexttoownandotherresearch)developedinconsultationwithlocalstakeholders. In
twocases, thelabelsusedintheresearchweredevelopedbyanon-governmentalor-
ganisation[67,75],andinonecase[50],existingvoluntarylabelswereenhancedbased

labelsand(2)studyingotherlabelmessagecharacteristicsandlabelformats.
3.2.1.LabelEffectiveness
AlargeonlineUKstudy[63]didnotfindthataddingatextwarningtoalcohol
drinklabelchangedperceivedpersonalrisk,motivationtodrinklessorperceptionof
damagingdrinkingamongadultdrinkers.Ontheotherhand,theCanadianreal-world
study,whichincludedputtingthreetypesoflabels(oneofthemacancerwarning)onthe
majorityofalcoholdrinksintheparticipatingliquorstoresinthestudiedregion,found
thattheseenhancedlabelsledtoincreasedrecall,cognitiveprocessingandself-reported
impact of drinking [51,54], as well as decreased alcohol sales [53] in the intervention
municipalitycomparedtothecontrolmunicipality.Whilethewholeinterventionincluded
bothcancerwarningsaswellaslow-riskguidelines/standarddrinklabels,itisnotpossible
tocompletelydisentangletheimpactofsolelythecancerwarninglabelsfromtheresults,
althoughsomeresultspointedtoeffectsbeingdrivenpredominantlybythecancerlabel.
Theonepaperthatlookedspecificallyatthecancerlabels[52]foundthatcancerlabels
increased knowledge of alcohol as a carcinogen, and that knowledge increased with
time.Additionally,theauthorsfoundthatknowledgeaboutalcoholcausingcancerwas
associatedwithagreaterlikelihoodofsupportinghealthwarninglabels.
3.2.2.LabelContent—Imagevs.Text
Amongtheeightpapersthatcomparedimageandtextlabels,sixhadcontrolgroup

thepapersusedgraphicimages(e.g.,diseasedbodypart);inone,theimageswereneutral,

4.Discussion
Thisreviewaimedtoexaminethescopeofthe(quasi-)experimentalresearchonnovel
andenhancedalcoholhealthwarninglabelsandtoidentifythekeycharacteristicsofthe
effectivewarninglabels.Twenty-sevenpaperswereincluded,themajorityofwhichwere
publishedin2018orlater,indicatinganuptakeininterestsurroundingthetopicfrom
theresearchcommunity(recognisedalsoinotherbroaderreviews[45]).Thisisaligned
withtheincreaseinpolicy-relatedlabellingdiscussions,suchasinCodexAlimentarius,at
theEUornationallevel(e.g.,[77,78]).AlloftheresearchhasbeenundertakeninWestern
countries, wherealcohollabellinghaseithernotbeenupdatedsinceitsimplementation
decadesago(e.g.,Canada,US),carriedoutonavoluntarybasis(e.g.,Australia,UK)ornot
mandatedatall(e.g.,manyoftheEUcountries).Givenhighalcoholconsumptioninthose
regions[79],thismayreflecttherecognitionoflabellingofpotentiallyeffectivemeansof
reducingalcohol-relatedharm—althoughitisdebatableifthisfocusaddstoorreplaces
focuson“bestbuys”policies[80],suchastaxation,pricingandadvertisingrestrictions.In
addition,themajorityofthestudiesfocusedongeneralpopulation,whichreflectsashiftfrom
findingsofpreviousreview[43],wherelessthanathirdofstudiesweretargetingthebroader
population,andtheremainingweretargetingyoungerpopulationsand(pregnant)women.
Intermsofcontent,mostcommonly,thestudiedmessageswerereferringtocancer—
70%ofpapersincludedatleastonecancer-relatedmessage,outofwhichthemostcom-
monlymentionedcancerswerebowel,breastandlivercancer.Thiswasfollowedbyliver
cirrhosisorliverdiseasemessages,usedinathirdofpapers. Othertopicsofmessages
wereheartdisease,mentalillness,braindamage,pregnancy,drinkinganddrivingand
other(e.g.,positiveexpectanciessurroundingalcohol). Thisbringsustothequestion
onhowtoselectthecontentofthemessagetobeincludedonthelabels. Inthepapers
includedinthisreview,researchershavecommonlyeitherdevelopedmessagesbasedon
“evidenceonalcohol-relatedharm”orhavetakenmessagesusedinotherstudies. We
wouldarguethatthemessagefirsthastoreflectevidence-basedrisk(e.g.,thatcausal
relationshipbetweenalcoholandtheoutcomehasbeenclearlydemonstrated[3]),and
thenthemessageshouldbetailoredtothecontextinwhichthelabelswillbedisplayed,
basedontheburdenofdisease.Anotherfactorthathasbeenfoundtobeimportantforthe
selectionofthemessageisalsoitsnoveltyforthegivenaudience[16,53].Forexample,in
theEU,29.4%ofallalcohol-attributabledeathsand19.4%ofallattributableDALYsare
duetocancers[81],whileawarenessoftheriskbetweenalcoholandcancerislow[15].
Basedontheseguidelineswecanconcludethatcancerwarningsshouldbeaprioritywhen
mandatinghealthwarninglabelsinthisregion.
Next,thefocusofresearchimpliestheresearcher’stheoryofchange—themechanisms

comesandhoweffectivenessismeasured.Thisisrelevantbecausethepolicydebatewill
inevitablydiscussthemeritofthehealthwarninglabelsbasedontheir“effectiveness”—
previously,oneoftheargumentsintheWorldTradeOrganisation’sdiscussionswasthat
labelsareconsideredunnecessaryinterferencewithinternationaltradebecausethereis
noscientificevidencetosupportsuchwarningsasaneffectivepublichealthmeasure[83].
Basedonthescopeoftheexistingresearch,weproposethattwopossibletheoriesofhow

proportiontonowbelower,at40%[21].Opinionsurveysindifferentcountrieshavealso
frequentlyfoundthatwhenpeopleareaskedtoestimatewhetheralcoholorillicitdrugs

Contrarytothesepopularandgovernmentalbiases,thehardevidenceisthatalcohol
usecontributesmorehealthharmsthanotherpsychoactivedrugsthatareprohibitedin
manycountries(i.e.,cannabis,opioids,stimulants,etc.).ThisisborneoutofWHOGlobal
BurdenofDiseaseestimateswhichmostrecentlyindicatethat2.4millionprematuredeaths
globallyareattributabletoalcohol,comparedwith0.49millionforillicitdrugsin2019[23].
InCanada,theongoingCanadianSubstanceUseCostsandHarms[24]projectreports
annuallyonestimatedhospitalisations,deathsandeconomiccostsfromalcohol,cannabis,
nicotine,opioidsandotherpsychoactivesubstances[24]. Theoveralleconomiccostof
substanceuseacrosshealthcare,lostproductivity,criminaljusticeandotherdirect-cost
domainswasestimatedat$46billionin2017.Accountingformorethanthree-quartersof
thetotalcostareCanada’sthreelegaldrugs:alcohol($16.6billion),tobacco($12.3billion)
andcannabis($3.2billion).Amongillicitsubstances,onlyopioids($5.9billion)andcocaine
($3.7billion)makeupmorethan5%ofthetotalcost[24].Thisdisparitypersistsevenata
timewhenthereisanopioidoverdosecrisis.Typically,publicdebatefocusesonthe“crises”
eveniftheharmanddeathratesarenotsubstantiallyhigherthanthosefromalcohol.
Partofthereasonforthelackofawarenessofalcohol-relatedharmsmaybetheextent
towhichthesearenotwhollyattributabletotheuseofalcohol.Alcohol’scontributions
toseriousillnesses,injuriesandprematuredeathsareusuallycontributoryandoftennot

thisrelativelysmallcontribution,becauseofthehighprevalenceofcanceringeneral,about
30%ofalcohol-attributabledeathsinCanadaarefromalcohol-relatedcancers[24](Note
thattheseestimatessumupthefractionsofliveslostorhospitalisationscausedtomakeup
eachpartiallyattributablecase).
Notsurprisingly,thereisevidenceworldwidethatfewmembersofthepublicare
awarethatalcoholisacarcinogen,despitetheWHO’sInternationalAgencyforResearch
onCancerhavingconfirmedacausalassociationmorethan30yearsago[27].Forexample,
anationalUKsurveyfoundthatonly13%ofrespondentscouldidentifyalcoholasacause

firstfullyearofthepandemic[33].
3.2.LowPublicAwarenessoftheEffectivenessofAlcoholPolicies
Babor et al. [11] advanced the influential narrative that effective alcohol policies
(principallyrestrictionsonpricingandavailability)areunpopularwiththepublicandtheir
electedrepresentatives,whilelesseffectiveeducationalstrategiesreceivethestrongest
supportinopinionsurveys. Thispositioniswellbasedonopinionresearchspanning
multiplecountrieswhichconsistentlysuggeststhatacross-the-boardpriceincreasesin
particulararethemostunpopularofallalcoholpolicyoptions. Forexample,acareful
analysisofpublicopiniononalcoholpolicyintheUKfound84%supportforpublic
informationcampaigns,whereasonly33%supportedincreasingthepriceofalcohol,41%
forreducingthenumberofliquoroutletsand39%forreducingtheirhoursoftrading[34].
Critically,Lietal.[34]wereabletoidentifyskepticismabouttheeffectivenessofdifferent
policiesasadeterminingfactorinwhethertheywouldbesupported.
Thereisalsoawidespreadbeliefthat“alcoholics”willalwaysaccessalcoholregard-
lessofpriceoravailability,aviewpointthatanyonewhohasdiscussedalcoholcontrol
policieswithdecision-makersormembersofthepublicwillhaveencountered. Thisis
contrarytoevidencefromathoroughsystematicreviewthatheavydrinkersdoreducetheir
drinkingwhenpricesincrease[35]andfromtheaccountsofalcohol-dependentdrinkers
themselves[36].
3.3.AbsentorInadequateGovernmentRegulatoryandLegislativeStructures
Governmentsinboththedevelopedanddevelopingworldsrarelygivehighlevel
considerationtoalcoholpolicy. Responsibilityfortheimplementationofthekindsof
evidence-basedpolicieslistedaboveisusuallyscatteredacrossmultipleministriesand
departments.Healthministriesaremostlyresponsibleforprovidinghealthcaretothesick
andinjuredratherthanaddressingunderlyingcausesandreducingriskfactors,thusthey
donothavedirectaccesstothemostimportantpolicylevers,namely,price,availability
andmarketingrestrictions.Financedepartmentsareresponsiblefortaxationandpricing

civicauthoritieswhoperhapsaremoreinclinedtoseetheirrolesaslimitingpublicnuisance
andoverseeingafairmarketratherthanprotectingpublichealth.Itisrareforpublichealth
considerationstoberepresentedinthelocal,regionalandnationalregulationofalcohol.
Thelowprioritygiventoalcoholbygovernmentsisoftenreflectedintheextentof
nationalandinternationalgovernmentfundingforresearch,preventionandtreatment.A
primeexampleisthesubstantiallylargerbudgetfortheUSNationalInstituteforDrug
AbusethanfortheUSNationalInstituteforAlcoholismandAlcoholAbuse,i.e.,USD1.3
billionversusUSD0.45billionin2020[37,38]. Thisbalanceofeffortandresourcingis
alsofrequentlyreflectedinnationalgovernmentdepartmentalbudgetsandnumbersof
dedicatedstaff.Forexample,HealthCanada’sAlcoholPolicyUnit(APU)hadabout1/6th
ofthestaffpositionsallocatedtotheOfficeofControlledSubstances[39].TheAPUhas
sincebeendownsizedandabsorbedintoanotherpublichealthunit.
Atvarioustimesandplaces,alcohol-relatedproblemshavebeendeemedsosevere

Researchers are working on numerous and varied approaches to improving the accessibility, quality,
effectiveness, and cost­effectiveness of treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs). This overview
article summarizes the approaches reviewed in this issue, including potential future developments for
alcoholism treatment, such as medications development, behavioral therapy, advances in technology
that are being used to improve treatment, integrated care of patients with AUDs and co­occurring
disorders, the role of 12­step programs in the broader realm of treatment, treating patients with
recurring and chronic alcohol dependence, strategies to close the gap between treatment need and
treatment utilization, and how changes in the health care system may affect the delivery of treatment.
This research will not only reveal new medications and behavioral therapies but also will contribute
to new ways of approaching current treatment problems. KEY WORDS: Alcohol use disorders; alcohol

Does Acetaldehyde Playa Role In
Alcohol ism?
Behavioral versus Biochemical Analysis
BRIAN R. SMITH, KAREN J. SPIVAK, and ZALMAN AMIT
1. INTRODUCTION
The issue whether acetaldehyde plays a functional role in the actions of alcohol remains
a controversial area following more than two decades of investigation. The publication
of several extensive reviews (Lindros, 1978; Amir et aI., 1980; von Wartburg, 1980;
Brien and Loomis, 1983, Amit and Smith, 1989) have left little doubt that the first
metabolic product of alcohol oxidation is an important contributor to some of the
consequences of exposure to ethanol. Unfortunately, despite the massive literature that
accumulated during this period, there is, as yet, little consensus concerning which
actions of alcohol (if any) are a function of the formation of acetaldehyde.
This chapter therefore reviews and evaluates the behavioral and psychophar
macological data on the possible role of acetaldehyde in the actions of alcohol. Further
more, we have based the argument on the contention that the positive reinforcing
properties of alcohol are the primary variables underlying the development of depen
dence on alcohol. It follows logically that any suggestion that acetaldehyde may playa
role in alcoholism must incorporate within its framework evidence supporting the in
volvement of acetaldehyde in those reinforcing and dependence-producing properties of
alcohol. This chapter was written as an attempt to do so. Finally, we have attempted to
evaluate the relevance of primarily negative biochemical data and contrast it with the
significance of a growing body of behavioral data supportive of this notion.

2. ACETALDEHYDE AS A TOXIC SUBSTANCE
Traditionally, acetaldehyde has been viewed as a toxic by-product of ethanol
metabolism (Hald and Jacobsen, 1948; Jacobsen, 1952). It is known, for example, that
prolonged ethanol exposure may disrupt liver function (Hasumura et aI., 1975). It was
perhaps because of these earlier observations that acetaldehyde's aversive effects have
initially drawn the greatest attention. The apparent toxicity of peripheral accumulation
of acetaldehyde has in fact served as the basis of a treatment model for alcoholism
(Ritchie, 1970; Sellers et aI., 1981). This presumably toxic elevation in blood con
centration of acetaldehyde was brought about through the use of pharmacological agents
that are capable of inhibiting hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Two such
agents widely used in the treatment of alcoholism are disulfiram (Antabuse) and the
cyanamide derivative calcium carbimide (Temposil) (Ritchie, 1970; Sellers et al.,
1981). In the presence of alcohol, these agents induce a reaction known as the disul
firam-alcohol reaction. Manifestations of this interaction include vasodilatation, ta
chycardia, decreased blood pressure, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting (Kitson, 1977;
Truitt and Walsh, 1971). In more severe cases, respiratory depression, cardiovascular
collapse, and death may occur (Jacobsen, 1952).
It had long been thought that the elevation of acetaldehyde levels via the use of
these agents served to limit alcohol drinking (Eriksson, 1980a; Lindros et al., 1975;
Schlesinger et aI., 1966; Sellers et al., 1981). It was demonstrated in both humans as
well as laboratory animals (although exceptions were, in fact, reported) that administra
tion of disulfiram or cyanamide reduced voluntary consumption of ethanol (see Lindros,
1978). This notion has been supported by investigations of the innate alcohol sensitivity
observed in some Orientals (Goedde et ai., 1979; Mizoi et aI., 1983; Wolff, 1972).
These studies revealed that approximately 50% of Japanese lack the hepatic mitochon
drial low Km isozyme of ALDH (Harada et aI., 1980; Mizoi et aI., 1983). Ingestion of
low to moderate doses of alcohol in these individuals results in much higher blood
acetaldehyde levels than that found in Caucasians after ingestion of similar amounts of
alcohol. Because of the inability to metabolize acetaldehyde quickly and efficiently,
these Orientals have a heightened sensitivity to alcohol and experience dysphoric reac
tions (Goedde et aI., 1979; Mizoi et al., 1979). This reaction is similar to that observed
in alcoholics who consume alcohol while receiving disulfiram or calcium carbimide
(Brien and Loomis, 1983; Tottmar et al., 1977). In a study conducted by Harada et a1.
(1983), approximately 40% of healthy Japanese males sampled displayed a deficiency in
the low Km isozyme of ALDH; however, only 2.3% of Japanese alcoholics were in this
group, suggesting that the deficiency of this isozyme of ALDH in Orientals may be a
genetic factor protecting this subpopulation from excessive alcohol intake and the subse
quent development of alcoholism.
3. ACETALDEHYDE AS A REWARDING AGENT
The foregoing seems to support the view that the effects of acetaldehyde were
primarily aversive in nature; however, clinical evidence and more recent experimental
data suggest that this may not be the case in every instance. There can be no question
that high concentrations of acetaldehyde circulating in blood have aversive conse-"

Stress and Coping Factors in the
Epidemiology of Substance Use
THOMAS ASHBY WILLS
1. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a systematic review of the role of stress and
coping factors in substance use. In recent years, accumulating evidence from epi
demiological studies has shown relationships between life stressors and substance use
for each of the major phases of use: initiation, maintenance, and relapse. This research
extends a line of investigation beginning with the tension reduction model of alcohol use
(Conger, 1956; Cappell and Herman, 1972) and encompasses new studies of stress
related predictors of cigarette smoking, tranquilizers, and opiate use. Here I consider
findings from field studies that provide evidence of stress-substance use relationships
for each of the three phases. After detailed review of the field evidence, a final section
discusses implications for theoretical models of substance use and abuse.
This chapter considers epidemiological research, studying factors that relate to
substance use behavior as it occurs in the natural environment of the respondents. The
question addressed is whether life stressors are consistently and causally related to
higher levels of tobacco, alcohol, and opiate use. Findings from animal models and
laboratory experiments with human subjects have shown evidence that stress affects
substance use in several paradigms (e.g., Abrams, 1983; Alexander and Hadaway,
1982; Hull and Van Treuren, 1986; Leventhal and Cleary, 1980). From human studies,
it is known that many persons try cigarettes and alcohol but relatively few become
regular or heavy users (e.g., Cleary et aI., 1988). Among regular smokers it is widely
perceived that cigarette smoking provides stress-reducing functions (U.S.D.H.H.S.,
1988), and similar expectancies about alcohol use have been found both among adoles
cents (Brown et aI., 1980; Christiansen et aI., 1982) and among adults (Cahalan et aI.,
1969; Deardorff et aI., 1975; Farber et aI., 1980; McCarty and Kaye, 1984). If sub-

stance use does provide affect-regulation functions for a significant proportion of users,
then linkages between stress and substance use should be observed in epidemiological
research. Thus, I address the evidence on stress-substance use relationships to deter
mine whether there are notable commonalities in predictive patterns across different
stages and types of substance use.
This chapter focuses on the proposition that substance use increases under stress
because it is perceived by the user to have an affect-regulation function. Substance use is
a multifactorial process: It may be promoted by social pressure or social modeling cues
(e.g., Biglan and Lichtenstein, 1984); long-term dependence may be maintained by
avoidance of physical withdrawal symptoms (Shiffman, 1979; Jaffe, 1980); and learning
processes may be involved in stimuli associated with drug use (Pomerleau, 1981; Siegel,
1979). I do not aim to minimize the importance of these processes in substance use.
Rather, the stress-related aspects of drug use seem to present an additional burden for the
dependent user, and understanding these aspects may improve understanding of sub
stance use initiation and relapse (Labouvie, 1986b; Wills and Shiffman, 1985).
Stress
Stress originates with demands from the environment and culminates in changes in
subjective well-being. Perceived stress is presumed to depend on an appraisal in which
demands from the environment are perceived by an individual as exceeding the available
coping resources (Cohen et aI., 1983; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). Life stress may be
acute, such as a sudden illness in the family, or may represent chronic life strains that are
not quickly resolved and persist over considerable periods of time (Pearlin et al., 1981).
At the physiological level, acute stress produces increases in sympathetic nervous sys
tem arousal, and chronic stress is linked to changes in endocrine systems and reactivity
to challenge (Baum et al., 1982; Grunberg and Baum, 1985). Perceived stress can cause
symptoms of general anxiety, tension, or depression; and subjective well-being is influ
enced independently by increased negative affect and decreased positive affect (Diener,
1984; Wills and Shiffman, 1985). In literature discussed here, objective measures of
stress have usually been based on checklists of major life events or chronic life strains,
and subjective distress has been indexed with questionnaire measures of anxiety, depres
sion, or general psychological symptomatology. This chapter is not critical of the stress
measures used, except for some theoretical issues discussed in the final section (for
detailed discussion see Baum et al., 1982).
The stress-coping process is presumed to be guided by ongoing appraisal of current
stressors in relation to current coping resources. As coping resources increase, the
perceived threat value of life stressors should decrease, but lack of effectiveness at initial
coping efforts should increase the current level of perceived stress (Cohen and William
son, 1988). The coping process is assumed to continue until major stressors are
eventually resolved; if further coping attempts are considered unlikely to be effective,
chronic stress would ensue.
In the context of overall coping processes, substance use may be construed as an
emotion-focused strategy, oriented toward reduction of emotional distress rather than
change of environmental conditions (Moos and Billings, 1982). A stress-coping model
posits that substance use is more likely when level of life stress is high, and when"

The Inverse Relationship between Tobacco
Use and Body Weight
NEIL E. GRUNBERG
1. INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoking in the United States is responsible for one-third of cardiovascular
diseases, one-third of cancer deaths, a large number of respiratory diseases, and a
substantial proportion of deaths by fire (USDHEW, 1979; USDHHS, 1982, 1983,
1984). Other forms of tobacco use (e.g., smokeless tobacco) are responsible for addi
tional cases of neck and head cancer (USDHHS, 1986; NIH Consensus Conference,
1986). In fact, more than twice as many deaths are caused by tobacco products in this
country than by all other addictive drugs combined, including alcohol (USDHHS,
1988). Despite the well-known and extensively documented health risks of cigarette
smoking and tobacco use, 51.1 million Americans smoke cigarettes and additional
millions consume other forms oftobacco (USDHHS, 1988). Improved understanding of
why people use tobacco products and are reluctant to give them up is important in order
to design more effective cessation and prevention strategies.
Many smokers report that control of body weight is a major reason why they smoke
and refuse to quit (Charlton, 1984; Klesges and Klesges, 1988; Page, 1983). This
chapter reviews evidence that there is an inverse relationship between cigarette smoking
and body weight and discusses the role of nicotine in this relationship. Possible reasons
for the inverse relationships between smoking and body weight, and nicotine and body
weight, are presented, and studies that examine each of these reasons are reviewed.
Mechanisms that may underlie the reasons for the nicotine/body weight relationship are
discussed. Finally, the data and postulates linking nicotine and body weight are consid
ered with respect to other pharmacological agents of addiction.

2. CIGARETTE SMOKING AND BODY WEIGHT
The generalization that cigarette smoking helps to control body weight is supported
by two types of data: (1) cross-sectional between-subjects comparisons of the body
weights of smokers and nonsmokers; and (2) longitudinal within-subject assessment of
the body weights of smokers who quit smoking compared to nonsmokers. These two
data bases are reviewed.
Between-Subjects Comparisons of the Body Weights of Smokers,
Nonsmokers, and Ex-smokers
Studies comparing the body weights of smokers and nonsmokers date back 100
years. There are several reports published in the 19th century that tobacco use stunts
growth (Otis, 1884; Kitchen, 1889; Seaver, 1897). Between 1900 and 1970, many
studies reported that tobacco use was associated with lower body weights (Anderson,
1914; Ashford et aI., 1961; Blackburn et aI., 1960; Bogen, 1929; Fink, 1921; Heath,
1958; Higgins and Kjelsberg, 1967; Holt, 1921; Jenkins et al., 1968; Lickint, 1933;
Pemberton and Macleod, 1956; Taylor, 1910). However, some studies conducted dur
ing this period reported no significant weight differences between smokers and non
smokers (Anderson, 1914; Diehl, 1929; Hadley, 1941; Holt, 1922-1923; Peters and
Ferris, 1967; Shah et aI., 1959; Short et al., 1939; Turley and Harrison, 1932).
Grunberg (1980, 1986a) pointed out that most of the null findings regarding smok
ing and body weight were based on studies of adolescents and young adult males. He
suggested that the limited exposure of these subjects to tobacco may be partially respon
sible for the lack of a smoking/body weight relationship. Also, the high metabolic rates
that naturally occur for young people may have masked or offset any effects of tobacco
on body weight. Possibly, the sex of the subjects contributed to the weak findings as
well.
Studies that included a large age range of subjects report a consistent inverse
relationship between cigarette smoking and body weight. Moreover, examination of
subjects by age group supports Grunberg's (1980, 1986a) suggestion that the null
findings reported by some investigators are attributable to the youth of their subjects.
For example, Higgins and Kjelsberg (1967) compared the body weights of 5020 smok
ers and nonsmokers who ranged in age from 16 to 79 years. Over all ages smokers
weighed significantly less (roughly 8 lb less) than did nonsmokers. However, the 16-to
19-year-old smokers had body weights similar to their nonsmoking counterparts.
Kopczynski (1972) studied 1245 smokers and 1814 nonsmokers and similarly reported
that, except for 19- to 20-year-old males, smokers weighed less than comparably aged
nonsmokers.
A recent review (USDHHS, 1988) of cross-sectional studies on smoking and body
weight published between 1971 and 1987 revealed the following (see Table 1): (1) 25 of
the 28 (i.e., 89%) studies found that smokers weighed less than nonsmokers; (2) one
study reported this relationship for women but not for men (Sutherland et aI., 1980); (3)
one study reported this relationship for 45-to 49-year-old men but not for 40-to 44-year
old men (Hjermann et aI., 1976); (4) one study did not find a body weight difference
(Waller and Brooks, 1972)."
"Effect of Alcoholism.pdf,page:1","Effect of Alcoholism
Introduction:
Alcoholism is a condition in which an individual becomes dependent on
alcohol. Dependence on alcohol interferes with the individual’s day to day
activities along with his personal and professional life. Alcoholism has
deleterious effects on one’s overall health. Organs such as the brain, liver,
heart, kidneys and stomach are most affected. Drinking alcohol during
pregnancy causes damage to the brain of the unborn child.
Signs and Symptoms:
Alcoholism or too much dependence on alcohol causes some short and long
term effects. Short term symptoms include drowsiness, vomiting, slurred
speech, stomach cramps, gastritis, headache, blurred vision, problems in
maintaining coordination, blackouts, anaemia or loss of oxygen supply to the
body.
Long-term signs and symptoms include drunken driving causing accidents,
domestic violence, alcohol poisoning, high blood pressure, stroke, liver
diseases, sexual problems, brain damage, ulcerations in the stomach, cancer
of the gut and throat.
Diagnosis:
The diagnosis of the effects of alcoholism requires a thorough insight to the
individual’s history. The physician asks a series of questions to the individual
as a means to diagnose. The American Psychiatric Association has
published some criterias in order to diagnose an individual with alcoholism
such as:
Tolerance- depends on the amount of alcohol required by the individual to feel
intoxicated.
Withdrawal symptoms- symptoms arising after abruptly stopping alcohol such"
"Effect of Alcoholism.pdf,page:2","as nausea, anxiety and vomiting.
Persistent desire to drink alcohol.
Abstaining from other activities for drinking.
Continued use of alcohol even after facing problems.
In order to be diagnosed as an alcoholic, the individual should aptly fit in the
above criterias.
Treatment:
Treatment for alcoholism includes:
Detoxification and withdrawal- the treatment begins with detoxification
programme for a period of four or seven days. Certain medications are
prescribed to curb the withdrawal symptoms such as headache,
sleeplessness, etc. Psychological counseling of the individual and family for
their support. Talk therapy also known as psychotherapy can also help to
treat the condition.
Complications/Side Effects:
Long term drinking of alcohol causes certain complications such as alcohol
hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), liver cirrhosis (scarring or fat deposition in
the liver causing irreversible damage to the liver), gastritis (inflammation of the
lining of the stomach), damage to the pancreas, heart attacks or strokes,
erectile dysfunction in men and menstrual problems in women, osteoporosis
(alcohol interferes with production of bone cells causing weakening of the
bones and fractures), neurological complications such as short term memory
loss and numbness of the hands and feet, increased risk of cancer of the
mouth, stomach, breast, kidneys, etc.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:8","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report aimed to review the empirical literature on the impact of parental alcohol use
disorders on family life. The report focused specifically on harms inflicted by the
problematic consumption of alcohol on members of the family, particularly spouses and
children, and on the functioning of the family unit as a whole. The key objectives of this
report were to (a) improve understanding of the nature and extent of the impacts, (b)
provide specific directions for future research, and (c) identify salient factors to be
incorporated in national health policies, and prevention and treatment initiatives that aim
to reduce the burden of alcohol use disorders in Australia.
It is important to note that the review is not all-inclusive. The impacts that were
considered most important and the ones for which there was considerable empirical
support were selected for review. The review relied on cross-sectional studies when more
rigorous longitudinal studies were not available. Much of the research has been
conducted internationally; however, where available, findings from large-scale cohort
studies in Australia and New Zealand have been included to improve understanding of
the links between parental alcohol use problems and family functioning within the local
context. The report also overviewed the available research on the impact of alcohol
within Indigenous communities in Australia.
The review demonstrated that there is a large body of research showing significant
associations between parental alcohol use disorders and a range of problems in family life
and functioning. These problems include, but are not limited to, parent and family
conflict and violence, parental separation and divorce, parent mental health and other
substance use problems, economic problems, disrupted parenting, parent-child
relationship problems and a range of mental health and cognitive disturbances in
offspring. This review has shown that these problems often co-occur in families affected
by parental drinking problems, particularly in families where both parents abuse or
depend on alcohol. As most studies in the literature reviewed have been cross-sectional,
problems in family life cannot be attributed solely to alcohol use. Rather, it is likely that
these factors interact in complex and dynamic ways, as well as with other macro- and
local environmental factors, to determine the specific impacts for each family.
The literature used in this review highlighted a number of conclusions:
1. The extent of harmful drinking patterns and alcohol use disorders among
Australian parents is significant.
2. Alcohol abuse is common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and has
frequently been linked to family violence.
3. Parental alcohol use disorders are associated with a range of problems in family
life.
4. Consideration of a developmental perspective is important in planning future
policy and practice.
5. Treatment and intervention efforts should address the multiple risks experienced
by families affected by parental drinking problems.
6. Prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk for a range of physical, cognitive
and mental health problems in children, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
Disorders. The question of whether there is a safe level of drinking during
pregnancy remains to be established.

1.1 Overview, aims and objectives
This report aims to review the empirical literature on the impact of parental alcohol use
disorders on family life. The report will focus specifically on harms inflicted by the
problematic consumption of alcohol on members of the family, particularly spouses and
children, and on the functioning of the family unit as a whole. The key objectives of this
report are to (a) improve understanding of the nature and extent of the impacts, (b)
provide specific directions for future research, and (c) identify salient factors to be
incorporated in national health policies, and prevention and treatment initiatives that aim
to reduce the burden of alcohol use disorders in Australia.
Although research evidence is consistent with regard to the adverse impact of parental
alcohol use disorders on family life, the relationship between alcohol and family
outcomes is complex. There are various issues that need to be considered if an
understanding of this relationship is to be gained. First, it is clear that difficulties in
family life are not the result of alcohol alone. Rather, alcohol use disorders are one of
numerous social, familial and individual risk factors that have been linked to problems in
family life. Research indicates that such factors often co-occur and interact in complex
ways, increasing the overall risk of problems in family life (The National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Colombia University [CASA], 2005; Eurocare and
The Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union [COFACE], 1998).
For example, it is not uncommon for families in which one or more parents have a
drinking problem to reside in communities with low average socio-economic status (SES)
and poor resources, or to suffer from comorbid psychological and physical health
problems, which compound the risk for problems in family life. This review therefore
aims to clarify understanding of the impact of alcohol use disorders on family life, whilst
acknowledging the context of a broader spectrum of factors that have been shown to
influence the risk of problematic family-related outcomes.
1.2 Description of studies included in the review
A large body of research has examined the impact of alcohol on family life. However,
given the space limitations for this paper, the review is not all-inclusive. The impacts that
were considered most important and for which there was considerable empirical support
were selected for review. Emphasis has been placed on the inclusion of longitudinal
studies that examine change in a given sample over an extended time, permitting the
identification of predictors of outcomes. We have relied on cross-sectional studies when
more rigorous longitudinal studies were not available. Cross-sectional studies are
important in identifying connections between predictors and outcomes that are both
assessed at the same point in time. Much of the research has been conducted
internationally; however, where available, findings from large-scale cohort studies in
Australia and New Zealand have been included to improve understanding of the links
between parental alcohol use problems and family functioning within the local context.
The report also overviews the available research on the impact of alcohol within
Indigenous communities in Australia.
6"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:11","Emphasis has also been placed on including research that identifies both the direct and
indirect ways in which alcohol impacts upon family life. Indirect influence refers to the
ability for proximal sources of influences to mediate or buffer more distal sources of
influence. For example, parental heavy drinking when children are young (distal
influence) can impact negatively on the quality of the parent-child relationship in
adolescence (proximal influence), which in turn may influence a young person’s choice of
deviant peer friendships. Knowledge of both direct and indirect relationships is
important if we are to tease apart the complex pathways of influence between parental
alcohol use problems and family functioning.
1.3 The spectrum of alcohol use: Key definitions
It is important to distinguish between terms used for alcohol use. ‘Alcohol use’ broadly
refers to any use of alcohol, from single occasion use at one end of the spectrum,
through to alcohol dependence on the other. ‘Alcohol misuse’ refers to use that is risky
(e.g. drink driving) and/or harmful (e.g. binge drinking). ‘Alcohol use disorder’ meets the
criteria under the class of substance-related and addictive disorders in the fifth edition of
the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders: DSM-5 (2013). These criteria define the disorder as a problematic pattern of
alcohol use that results in clinically significant impairment or distress, often referred to in
the literature as ‘alcohol abuse’. In DSM-5, the categories of ‘alcohol abuse’ and ‘alcohol
dependence’ were combined to define a single disorder on a continuum from mild to
severe. Many studies included in this review use diagnostic criteria from the earlier
editions of the manual (e.g. DSM-III, APA, 1980; DSM-IV, APA, 1994) and refer to the
separate categories of alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence which includes features of
tolerance. Clear definitions of the alcohol use terminology are important because the
effects of alcohol vary depending on level and frequency of use.
This review will focus on the impact of parental alcohol abuse and dependence, referred
to as ‘alcohol use disorders’. However, it is important to acknowledge that not all
alcohol-related problems that affect families necessarily arise from clinical disorders.
Indeed, the majority of empirical studies have used broader definitions of alcohol-related
difficulties such as ‘problem drinking’ or ‘heavy drinking’. Current Australian Alcohol
Guidelines are consistent for men and women, and recommend drinking no more than
two standard drinks per day to avoid risk of long-term harm from alcohol-related disease
or injury, and drinking no more than four standard drinks on a single occasion to avoid
alcohol-related injury (National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC], 2009).
Drinking more than 14 standard drinks per week is often defined in the literature as
‘heavy drinking’ while greater than four drinks in a single occasion can be defined as
‘binge’ drinking (Maloney et al., 2010). Many Australian studies prior to 2009 used less
conservative definitions of short- and long-term harm based on the 2001 Australian
Alcohol Guidelines (NHMRC, 2001). This prevents accurate comparisons of the
different datasets using these varied terms and definitions. Despite variation between
studies in how drinking problems have been operationalised, these terms generally refer
to elevated levels or harmful patterns of alcohol consumption (e.g. regular excessive
consumption and drinking to intoxication), that do not necessarily meet criteria for an
alcohol use disorder. As these kinds of drinking patterns can also have adverse impacts
on family life, studies that have used broader definitions of alcohol use problems have
been included in the review and the distinction in terminology has been clearly noted.

AND ALCOHOL USE PROBLEMS IN FAMILIES
2.1 Introduction
There is little published Australian data available on the prevalence of parental alcohol
use problems that meet criteria for a clinical disorder. The 2007 Australian National
Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB) used a national stratified
randomised sample (N = 8,841) to establish the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in
the general Australian population. The study found that 22.7 per cent of Australians had
experienced an alcohol use disorder at some point in their lifetime, and 4.3 per cent had
an alcohol use disorder in the preceding 12 months. Specifically, in the 12-month period
prior to 2007, 2.9 per cent of the Australian population (adults aged 16 to 85) met DSM-
IV criteria for alcohol abuse and a further 1.4 per cent met criteria for alcohol
dependence (Teesson et al., 2010). Correlates of alcohol use disorders within the
previous 12 months were gender (male), age (young), marital status (un-married), country
of birth (Australia or another English-speaking country), and having an anxiety or other
drug use disorder.
Twelve-month prevalence rates for substance use disorders according to household
composition were also reported in the 2007 NSMHWB. These figures showed that 4.5
per cent of individuals from couple families with children and 9.1 per cent of those from
one parent families with children met criteria for substance use disorders, compared to
5.1 per cent of the general Australian population aged 16 to 85 years (Teesson et al.,
2010). It is important to note that although the majority of substance use disorders
comprise those relating to alcohol use, these figures do include other drug use disorders,
and thus limited conclusions can be drawn specifically about alcohol use disorders
among parents.
Despite the limited evidence concerning parental alcohol use disorders, there is emerging
information on parental drinking that may be defined as ‘excessive’ according to current
NHMRC guidelines. The remainder of this chapter will summarise current data regarding
drinking in families that is available from Australia, following which it will provide a brief
overview of the international research in the area.
2.2 Prevalence of alcohol use and alcohol use problems in
Australian families
The most recent data regarding parental alcohol use was derived from the National Drug
Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), which has been conducted in Australia
approximately every three years since 1985, using a multi-stage, stratified area random
sample design. The latest survey was carried out in 2010 using a sample of 26,648 adults
across Australia (Australian Insitute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2011a). Results of
the survey found 18.6 per cent of single parents of dependent children and 19.5 per cent
of parents in a couple relationship with dependent children consumed alcohol at a level
that placed them at lifetime risk of alcohol-related harm according to current NHMRC
alcohol guidelines (more than two standard drinks per day). These figures for parents
were slightly lower than the corresponding figure of 20.1 per cent for the general
Australian population aged 14 years or over. Data from the same survey showed that
16.9 per cent and 14.3 per cent of single and coupled parents of dependent children,
8"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:13","respectively, engaged in binge drinking (consuming more than four standard drinks on a
single occasion) on at least a weekly basis, compared to 15.9 per cent of all individuals
aged 14 years or over (AIHW, 2011a). A report based on data from the 2007 NDSHS
survey suggests that overall, parents are less likely to consume alcohol at risky levels
compared to individuals without dependent children (Maloney et al., 2010). Nevertheless,
estimates based on this same data, and using the 2008 population figures from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to extrapolate prevalence in the general population,
suggest that 17-34 per cent of dependent Australian children aged 0 to 14 years are raised
in an environment where heavy or binge drinking is occurring (Maloney et al., 2010).
It is important when considering the data from surveys such as the NDSHS to
acknowledge the limitations inherent in such national datasets, as highlighted by a
number of authors (e.g. Dawe et al., 2007; Maloney et al., 2010). These limitations
include the potential for respondents to underestimate their alcohol use in such self-
report surveys due to a social desirability bias, as well as lack of awareness about the
quantity of a standard drink as the unit of measurement. Indeed, less than 50 per cent of
known alcohol sales were accounted for by responses to the 1998 NDSHS (Stockwell et
al., 2004). Response rates for the 2007 and 2010 NDSHS were 51.6 per cent and 50.6 per
cent respectively, leaving open the possibility that respondents may differ from those
who did not complete the survey in their alcohol use patterns. Furthermore, such surveys
tend to under-sample minority and marginalised groups in society, which may further
influence the prevalence estimates reported.
Bearing in mind such limitations, there is information available with regard to the
characteristics that predict risky drinking among Australian parents, although it should be
noted that the cross-sectional design of the surveys on which these findings are based
prevents conclusions being drawn about the causal direction of these relationships.
Consistent with gender differences noted in the general population (Teesson et al., 2010;
AIHW, 2011a), reports based on data from a number of surveys have indicated that
fathers are more likely to engage in risky alcohol use than mothers (Dawe et al., 2007;
Maloney et al., 2010). Additional factors that have been found to predict risky drinking
patterns among parents based on the 2007 NDSHS data are: being a current tobacco-
smoker, higher levels of psychological distress, and lower educational levels
(Maloney et al., 2010). Monthly and weekly binge drinking among parents has also been
found to be associated with younger age; as well as household composition, with single
mothers being more likely to report binge drinking than mothers from couple families
(Dawe et al., 2007; Maloney et al., 2010). Furthermore, Maloney et al. (2010) found that
parents who were currently employed and had a higher level of household income were
more likely to engage in monthly binge drinking as well as heavy alcohol consumption
that put them at risk of long-term harm.
Analysis of Australian survey datasets by Dawe et al. (2007) also suggest that the age of
one’s children may be related to alcohol use patterns. Specifically, their analyses of data
from The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) indicated that
among women in the 25 to 30 year age group, rates of binge drinking once or more per
week were higher among those with children aged six to 12 years (11.4 per cent) or 13 to
16 years (11.8 per cent), compared to those with children under 12 months (3.6 per cent)
or aged one to five (6.3 per cent). Their analyses of data from the 2001 National Health
Survey however, showed that in households with children, there was no difference in
alcohol risk status according to the number of children living in the household (Dawe et
al., 2007).
9"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:14","Other Australian data suggest that there are specific sub-groups in the community in
which parents and caregivers appear to be at elevated risk for alcohol problems. For
example, statistics show that alcohol use disorders are particularly common among
parents of children who enter the child protection and out-of-home care system
(Ainsworth, 2004); however, these data are often conflated with illicit drug use disorders.
Alcohol was a risk factor in an estimated 19,443 cases of substantiated child abuse during
2006 and 2007, and between 24,581 and 31,656 cases of domestic violence reported to
police in 2005 (Laslett et al., 2012). A report from the Department of Children and
Family Services in Western Australia found that drug and alcohol use was a concern in 50
per cent of cases where family reunification was under consideration (Ainsworth &
Summers, 2001). It has also been estimated that up to 80 per cent of all child abuse
reports investigated by the New South Wales Department of Community Services (2002)
involve concerns about drug and alcohol-affected parenting. Recent figures estimate 33
per cent of the substantiated cases examined by the Victorian Child Protection Services
between 2001 and 2005 involved alcohol use. The variability of these rates may be
attributable to differences in the practice of recording and coding between states (Laslett,
Dietze & Room, 2012).
In the Victorian sample the prevalence of alcohol use was greater in those cases that were
heard in court (41.7 per cent). These cases required more serious interventions and
resulted in poorer outcomes for the children when there were numerous risk factors also
present, including significant socio-economic disadvantage, unemployment, unstable
family structure, psychiatric comorbidities and the parent’s own history of abuse (Laslett,
Dietze et al., 2012). A 2008 population estimate based on a sample of 1,142 parents and
primary carers suggests that 22 per cent of Australian families have one or more children
who have experienced general alcohol-related harm as a result of someone else’s
drinking, and 12 per cent of families identified a specific alcohol-related harm such as
verbal abuse, physical injury, neglect and lack of supervision, and witnessing domestic
violence. These harms were most commonly perpetrated by an immediate family
member (61 per cent) or a relative (12 per cent), and were more common in single-carer
households and households with low income or socio-economic disadvantage (Laslett,
Ferris et al., 2012).
Data on the prevalence of parental alcohol use and problematic drinking in Australian
Indigenous populations are limited, but indicate that this group consume alcohol in a
more risky manner than the general population. For example, 38 per cent of Indigenous
women and 60 per cent of Indigenous men reported typically drinking nine or more
standard drinks when they drank, compared to one per cent of women and five per cent
of men in the general population (Saggers & Gray, 1998). More recent data from the
2010 NDSHS support these trends, indicating that Indigenous Australians are more likely
to abstain from drinking than non-Indigenous people (24.5 per cent and 19 per cent
respectively); however, when they drink they are 1.5 times likely to do so at high-risk
levels for both single occasion (52 per cent) and lifetime harm (31 per cent) (AIHW,
2011a). It is likely, however, that these figures underestimate Indigenous substance use in
comparison to other groups because they are less likely to dwell in the standard private
households sampled in most surveys or are living in remote areas (Chikritzhs & Brady,
2006; Fitzpatrick et al., 2012).
In summary, the available evidence from Australia suggests that while alcohol use
disorders are not widespread among families in the general community, binge drinking
10"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:15","appears relatively common, especially among fathers and single mothers. The data also
show that there are specific sub-groups of parents and caregivers who are at particularly
high-risk of suffering alcohol use disorders. This includes disadvantaged socio-economic
groups such as parents of children who enter the child protection system, and
Indigenous Australian parents. As with all of these studies, prevalence rates have been
estimated from samples within communities, states, or national surveys, and are subject
to limitations such as underreporting of consumption. Further epidemiological research
is needed to provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of parental alcohol use
problems in Australian families and within specific sub-groups in Australia.
2.3 International research on the prevalence of alcohol use
problems in families
A number of international studies have examined the prevalence of alcohol use disorders
among people who are parents or who have significant responsibility for the care of
children. Using responses from the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH), data were collected between 2002 and 2007 from 87,656 respondents on the
number of children in the United States (US) living with substance abusing or substance
dependent parents (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
[SAMHSA], 2009). The survey focused on biological, step, adoptive, and foster children
younger than 18 years of age who were living with one or both parents at the time of the
study interview. Estimates indicated that between 2002 and 2007 almost 7.3 million
children (approximately 10.3 per cent) lived with at least one parent who abused or was
dependent on alcohol . This is substantially lower than earlier figures suggested by Grant
(2000) who estimated that more than 19 million (28.6 per cent) US children had been
exposed to parental alcohol abuse of dependence within the family before the age of 18,
based on data from the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey in 1992
(N = 42,862). Canadian prevalence estimates are slightly lower, based on 2002 Canadian
Community Health Survey data (N=36,984), suggesting that 8.3 per cent of Canadian
children under 12 were exposed to parental alcohol abuse or dependence in the prior 12
months (Bassani et al., 2009).
Epidemiological research indicates that parental alcohol use problems are also common
throughout Europe. Based on extrapolated survey data from Denmark and Finland in
the late 1990s, it was estimated that between 4.5 and 7.9 million children (approximately
12 to 21 per cent) under 15 years of age in European Union countries were living in
households affected by parental alcohol misuse (Eurocare & COFACE, 1998). There
have been some criticisms of the methodology used to calculate these rates, since many
European countries did not directly assess prevalence and based the estimates on
extrapolations using data from only two countries (Harwin et al., 2010). Of the countries
which collected first-hand survey data on national child prevalence rates, there was
considerable variability with estimates of the number of children under 18 years who are
exposed to parental alcohol misuse ranging from 2.7 per cent in Lithuania to 19.3 per
cent in Poland (Harwin et al., 2010). Unfortunately, the ENCARE report (Harwin et al.,
2010) did not elucidate whether these statistics are lifetime prevalence rates or based on
the previous 12 months from the time of the survey, preventing comparison with other
international prevalence data.
International figures for risky or binge drinking show less variability between countries of
similar socio-economic status. Recent estimates from the US indicate that 23.8 per cent
of children under the age of 18 (17 million) currently live in a household where a parent
11"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:16","or other adult [authors’ italics] is a binge or heavy drinker (where binge drinking is defined
as five or more drinks in one occasion, and heavy drinking is defined as five or more
drinks on one occasion on five or more days in the past month) (CASA, 2005). Data
from Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) also show similar rates for binge drinking.
A meta-analysis in 2009 of five UK National Household Surveys conducted between
2000 and 2004 indicated that between 3.3 and 3.5 million children under 16 years of age
(roughly 30 per cent) in the UK live with at least one binge drinking parent (defined as
six or more drinks for women in a single occasion, and eight or more drinks for men)
(Manning et al., 2009). This is comparable to the estimate for Australia as reported
above, suggesting that 17 to 34 per cent of those under 14 years are exposed to binge or
heavy parental drinking (four or more drinks in a single occasion or 14 or more drinks
per week respectively) (Maloney et al., 2010). However, these data should be interpreted
with caution because they use different definitions of binge and heavy drinking, different
age ranges for children, and some of these surveys include adults within the household
who are not the parent or primary caregiver, making comparisons difficult.
Despite similarities between several countries in rates of binge and heavy drinking, it is
interesting to note that the prevalence of alcohol dependence is significantly lower in
Asian countries (between 0.2 and 7.3 per cent of each country’s population) than in the
Americas, Europe and Australia (Chen & Yin, 2008). Socio-economic, cultural and
biological factors are believed to account for the lower rates of problem drinking in these
Asian populations, such as Iran, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. Although there is a
paucity of studies looking at the prevalence of alcohol misuse among parents in Asian
countries, it is expected that these data would reveal lower rates of children being
exposed to parental problem drinking in Asian countries, but similar associations
between parental drinking and negative impacts on families and children (Hung, Yen &
Wu, 2009).
There are several limitations to consider when comparing international statistics. First,
studies generally do not measure alcohol use in the same way; second, they define
children by differing age ranges. Third, few surveys directly assess the prevalence of
problem drinking in the family and the numbers of children affected, and some surveys
include adults within the household who are not the parent or primary caregiver, so that
most statistics are estimates based on many different assumptions. Fourth, surveys that
provide information on such prevalence statistics acknowledge the limitations of self-
report and the likelihood that rates of risky drinking are underreported in such samples.
While cross-cultural studies assessing the prevalence of children’s exposure to parental
drinking are currently not available, data from these international sources make it clear
that there are a significant number of families and children in the US, Canada, Europe,
and Australia adversely affected by parental alcohol use problems.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:17","CHAPTER 3. FRAMEWORK FOR REVIEWING
LITERATURE
Two theoretical frameworks have been used as a basis for conceptualising the relationship
between parental alcohol use disorders and problems in family life. The first is an adapted
version of a model of the structural determinants of youth drug use, proposed by Spooner, Hall,
and Lynskey (2001). The model was designed to understand the various levels of influence
involved in the development of youth drug use. Within the context of this review, this model
also serves as a useful framework for conceptualising the range of factors likely to influence
the relationship between parental alcohol use and family functioning, including the related
development of substance use in young family members.
Figure 1 illustrates the model, which proposes that there are different levels of influence that
span a continuum, ranging from macro-environmental factors at one end, through to
individual micro-level factors at the other end. Within the context of the current review,
macro- and local environmental factors refer to societal, cultural and economic factors
known to influence average alcohol consumption (Edwards et al., 1994; Babor et al., 2003).
Examples of these types of factors include cultural drinking norms, religious sanctions, the
availability and pricing of alcohol, and media advertising. In addition to macro- and local
environmental influences, there are a range of micro-level factors in society that influence
alcohol consumption in both parents and in children. These include family and individual
factors such as employment and income, marital quality, parenting skills and mental health
problems (e.g. Mitchell et al., 2001; Hayes et al., 2004).
Each level of influence in the model is thought to have both direct and indirect influence on
the other levels of influence (Spooner et al., 2001). Influences can also be bi-directional, in
that individuals can influence their family, peers and work or school life, as well as the
macro-environment. This review deals predominantly with micro-level influences, focusing
specifically on parental drinking, the family unit, and on individual factors that are related to
family life and alcohol use. This review does not focus on macro- and local environmental
factors specifically, but acknowledges that such environmental factors do impact on parental
alcohol use and related harms.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:19","Figure 2 shows the second model, which focuses specifically on parental alcohol use
disorders and family effects (Jacob & Leonard, 1994). The model depicts the pathways via
which parental alcohol problems are theorised to impact on family functioning, and in turn,
how these family effects contribute to the development of child problem behaviour and
alcohol use. Specifically, the model proposes that there are several pathways via which family
variables can influence child problem behaviour and alcohol use. These pathways include
alcohol-specific family effects that are either genetically or environmentally mediated, as well
as non-alcohol-specific effects that are primarily related to disruptions in child socialisation
and development. The unique quality of this multivariate model is that it conceptualises the
relationship between parental alcohol use disorders and family life whilst accounting for the
influence of a range of other individual and familial risks.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:21","CHAPTER 4. REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL LITERATURE
ON THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS ON
FAMILIES
4.1 Five key areas in the research literature
Research on the impact of alcohol use disorders on family life has been segregated into five
sections based on key themes that emerged in the literature. These sections examine, in turn,
the relationship between alcohol use disorders in parents and:
(1) marital and intimate partner relationship quality;
(2) family functioning;
(3) co-occurring mental health and other substance use disorders in parents;
(4) parenting; and,
(5) physical, cognitive and mental health outcomes in children.
4.2 Impact on marital and intimate partner relationships
4.2.1 Marital/intimate partner dissatisfaction and breakdown
Evidence of association
Alcohol use disorders have consistently been associated with marital dissatisfaction and
conflict (Leonard & Eiden, 2007; Jacob & Leonard, 1994; Marshal, 2003; Tubman, 1993).
Case-control studies indicate that the home environments of families affected by alcohol use
are characterised by elevated levels of marital discord compared to families not affected by
alcohol use (Eiden et al., 2004; Leonard & Jacob, 1997; Tubman, 1993). Epidemiologic
studies conducted in the US and Canada (Goering et al., 1996) have also demonstrated cross-
sectional associations between marital dissatisfaction and alcohol use disorders.
Treatment studies provide support for a relationship between alcohol use disorders and
intimate partner or marital problems. Married and cohabiting males entering treatment for
alcohol use disorders have been shown to report high levels of marital distress (Stuart et al.,
2003), non-violent conflict (Murphy et al., 2005), and poor relationship functioning and
adjustment (O’Farrell et al., 2004). Couples seeking marital therapy also frequently report
alcohol use problems, particularly in male partners, as a major source of marital conflict
(Halford & Osgarby, 1993).
Given the relationship of alcohol use disorders with marital dissatisfaction and conflict, it is
not surprising that separation and divorce are more common among marriages in which at
least one partner abuses alcohol. General population studies indicate that heavy alcohol
consumption and frequent drinking episodes are associated with elevated rates of separation
and divorce. Marriages in the UK where one or both parents have an alcohol problem are
twice as likely to end in divorce as marriages where alcohol problems are absent (Prime
Minister’s Strategy Unit, 2004). There is a paucity of Australian research in this area,
although a national community survey of 650 divorced men and women found that 11 per
17"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:22","cent of women and three per cent of men reported alcohol or drug abuse as the main reason
for their divorce (Wolcott & Hughes, 1999).
Taken together, research has identified significant associations between alcohol use disorders
and intimate partner or marital dissatisfaction and separation. However, it is by no means
clear that abuse of alcohol is causally related to marital problems. The following section
examines the evidence provided by longitudinal studies on this issue.
Evidence relating to causality
There is some evidence from longitudinal studies that alcohol use problems predict
subsequent marital dissatisfaction. Zweben (1986) examined a clinical sample of 87 couples
12 months after receiving conjoint therapy or counselling advice. The study found that the
likelihood of marital disruption was significantly greater among heavy-drinking couples than
non-heavy-drinking couples. The relationship between problem use and marital satisfaction
was found to be mediated by stress associated with alcohol problems. Outside the clinical
setting, Testa and Leonard (2001) examined a representative sample of newlywed couples
(N = 387) at the time of their marriage and at their one-year anniversary. They found that
alcohol dependence in men was associated with lower marital satisfaction among wives at
follow-up. Interestingly, alcohol consumption and binge drinking were not associated with
lower marital satisfaction. The investigators suggested that it is the problems associated with
alcohol dependence, rather than alcohol consumption per se, that have an adverse effect on
marital functioning.
Other studies have examined the association between relationship breakdown and per capita
alcohol consumption (Lester, 1997; Caces et al.,1999). Lester (1997) conducted a time series
analysis of data from the US and Europe between 1950 and 1972 and found that among
seven of the eight nations studied, the more alcohol consumed per capita, the higher the
divorce rate. Caces et al (1999) examined the per capita consumption of alcohol in the US
between 1934 and 1987. Results there indicated that a consumption increase of one litre of
alcohol per capita brought about a 20 per cent increase in the divorce rate. Reciprocally, an
increase of 1/1000 in the divorce rate also led to a 10 per cent increase in alcohol
expenditure (Caces et al., 1999). These results provide support for the notion that a bi-
directional influence may exist between alcohol consumption and divorce rates.
A number of longitudinal studies conducted internationally have examined the relationship
of alcohol use specifically to separation and divorce. Wilsnack et al. (1991) compared 143
problem drinkers and 157 non-problem drinkers in a female sample over a five-year period.
Results indicated that the relationship between alcohol use and divorce or separation was
moderated by problem drinking status at baseline. Among non-problem drinkers, higher
average consumption and frequency of intoxication at baseline were related to separation
and divorce across time. Interestingly, divorce or separation was found to predict lower
levels of subsequent alcohol dependence among problem drinkers. These results suggest that
separation and divorce were more likely to follow, than precede, heavier drinking in women.
Power and Estaugh (1990) examined a large (N = 9,337) representative cohort of young
people in Great Britain and found that partnerships among heavy drinkers were relatively
unstable. Examination of drinking levels at ages 16 and 23 indicated that relationship
18"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:23","breakdown was common in young men and women who had been heavy drinkers at both
time points and among those increasing consumption between adolescence and early
adulthood. The direction of effect could not be established because the temporal sequencing
of partnership breakdown and heavy drinking was not clear over the seven-year period (i.e.
difficult emotional relationships and excessive drinking may occur simultaneously).
However, relationship breakdown was confounded by other factors including economic
status, housing tenure, and having children. In a later follow-up of the cohort, Power,
Rodgers and Hope (1999) examined the relationship between heavy alcohol consumption
and marital status at age 23 and 33 (N = 11,405). The study found that 23-year-old heavy
drinkers were not significantly more likely to divorce than those who did not drink heavily.
However, marital separation was accompanied by short-term increases in heavy drinking,
suggesting that alcohol may be used as a temporary means of coping with relationship
breakdown and its concomitants.
Locke and Newcomb (2003) conducted a 16-year prospective study of women (N = 305)
using a community sample in which alcohol use was identified as a significant predictor of
marital dissatisfaction. The study also found that comorbid alcohol involvement and
dysphoria during young adulthood was a stronger predictor of relationship maladjustment in
adulthood than either alcohol involvement or dysphoria alone.
Other evidence suggests that the predictive relationship between marital dissatisfaction and
problem drinking may be bi-directional. In several prospective studies, marital functioning
has been shown to predict the likelihood of relapse and time to relapse among people in
treatment for alcohol dependence (Maisto, McKay & O’Farrell, 1998; O’Farrell et al., 1998).
Moreover, in a community study of 1,675 married couples in the US, baseline marital
dissatisfaction was prospectively associated with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence
at the 12-month follow-up (Whisman, Uebelacker & Bruce, 2006). Both male and female
spouses who were dissatisfied with their marriage at baseline were 3.4 times more likely to
have a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at follow-up than satisfied spouses, after controlling
for demographic variables and history of alcohol use disorders. However, the generalisability
of the findings is limited because only 14 people met criteria for current alcohol use disorder
at follow-up.
Homish and Leonard (2007) followed up a sample of 634 couples at their first- and second-
year anniversaries using prospective time-lagged analyses and found that decreased marital
satisfaction was associated with discrepant heavy drinking. This refers to reported
differences between martial partners in their frequency of drinking to intoxication and in the
frequency of heavy drinking (six or more drinks). These authors reported in an earlier study
that greater levels of marital satisfaction usually occurred when partners drank together at
similar quantities and frequencies (Homish & Leonard, 2005). A later follow-up of this
cohort revealed that among those with high marital satisfaction, marriage is associated with a
decline in drinking behaviours and reduced risk for alcohol problems (Leonard & Homish,
2008). For those who continued to display heavy drinking and alcohol use problems up to
four years after marriage, the identified predictive factors were pre-existing alcohol problems
and heavy drinking prior to marriage, antisocial characteristics, family history of alcohol
abuse, negative effect, and alcohol expectancies.
Data also suggest that congruence between partners in drinking behaviours may positively
influence marital satisfaction. Floyd et al (2006) studied individually rated positive and
19"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:24","negative marital behaviours in 132 couples, comparing alcohol-dependent and non-
dependent combinations of husbands and wives. They also examined the influence of
antisocial behaviour in the husband, noting that the comorbid prevalence of alcohol use
disorders in those with antisocial personality disorder was 74 per cent (Floyd et al., 2006).
They found that irrespective of the alcohol dependence status of the wife, more hostile
behaviours occurred in relationships where the husband had antisocial behaviours and was
alcohol dependent. However, there were a greater proportion of positive behaviours when
alcohol dependence was congruent, i.e. where either both of the spouses or neither of the
spouses had a diagnosis related to alcohol use.
Also supporting the notion of the relevance of matched drinking behaviours, a large and
representative longitudinal study (N = 4,589) conducted in the US between 1992 and 2000
found that discrepant drinking levels (rather than actual drinking levels) in partners were
predictive of marital dissolution (Ostermann, Sloan & Taylor, 2005). This study also found
that history of problem drinking by either spouse was not associated with an increased risk
of divorce.
Conclusion
In summary, evidence from epidemiology and treatment settings suggests that elevated
alcohol misuse in families leads to increased marital discord. In terms of the predictive
relationship between alcohol misuse and marital outcomes, the evidence suggests that
influences can be in either direction over time. Thus it is likely that marital dissatisfaction can
be a cause as well as a consequence of alcohol misuse. In studies where comorbid psychiatric
variables are controlled, results support the notion that incongruent drinking, rather than
heavy drinking per se, is most strongly associated with marital discord. This is usually where
the male is the heavy drinker but can occur where the female is the heavy drinker as well.
These findings highlight the need for routine assessment and treatment of problematic
drinking in couples seeking relationship therapy, and reciprocally, assessment and treatment
of relationship problems among individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders.
4.2.2 Marital/intimate partner violence
Evidence of association
Australian survey data reveals that in the 12 months preceding the 2007 NDSHS, six per
cent of men and three per cent of women had experienced physical abuse by someone
affected by alcohol. For 43 per cent of those females, the perpetrator of the physical abuse
was a current or former spouse or partner, compared to only nine per cent of the male
respondents (Laslett et al., 2010). For women who had a current or previous partner, 31 per
cent experienced physical partner violence during their lifetime and three per cent of women
had experienced physical violence from a partner within the last 12 months. Approximately
one in three incidents of partner violence experienced in the last year (35 per cent) were
alcohol-related, measured by women reporting that their partner was drinking alcohol at the
time of the violent act (Laslett et al., 2010). AIHW data from 2002/03 also found that a
significant proportion of the burden of disease for domestic violence (9.3 per cent),
20"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:25","measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years was attributable to alcohol use (Access
Economics, 2004).
The impact of men’s drinking on domestic violence
A large body of research has been dedicated to understanding the relationship between
alcohol use disorders and intimate partner or marital violence. A strong relationship has
consistently been identified between male-perpetrated intimate partner violence and alcohol
problems (Finney, 2004; Heyman, O’Leary & Jouriles, 1995; Holtzworth-Munroe et al.,
1997; Leonard & Jacob, 1988; Leonard & Senchak, 1993; Quigley & Leonard, 2000).
Maritally violent men are significantly more likely than a wide variety of comparison groups
to abuse alcohol (Holtzworth-Munroe et al., 1997). Physically aggressive episodes have been
shown to be four times as likely as verbally aggressive episodes to involve the husband’s
drinking (Quigley & Leonard, 2000; Testa, Quigley & Eiden, 2003). These episodes are also
more likely to result in injury to the victim and consequent reporting to the police if the
partner was drinking at the time of the incident (Thompson & Kingree, 2006). In Australia,
alcohol is involved in around 50 per cent of domestic and sexual violence cases (English et
al., 1995). The Australian component of the International Violence Against Women Survey
(Mouzos & Makkai, 2004) found that some 35 per cent of women recalled their partners
being under the influence of alcohol on the last occasion of partner violence. The survey also
found that women whose husbands got “drunk a couple of times a month or more” were
three times more likely to experience domestic violence than women whose partners drank
less (pp 58-59).
Treatment studies provide further evidence of a link between alcohol abuse and intimate
partner violence. These studies indicate that marital violence is overrepresented among
individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders, and reciprocally, that alcohol abuse is
overrepresented among individuals seeking treatment for domestic violence. Among men
entering treatment for alcohol dependence in the United States, the annual prevalence of
partner violence is 50 to 70 per cent, and the prevalence of severe, potentially injurious
violence is 20 to 30 per cent. These rates are four to eight times higher than the prevalence
statistics for demographically similar non-alcohol-dependent men (O’Farrell & Murphy,
1995; O’Farrell et al., 2003). Fals-Stewart (2003) found that around 40 per cent of men in
treatment for partner violence report a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. According
to the study, the odds of any male-to-female aggression were more than eight times higher
on days when men drank than on days of no alcohol consumption. Similarly, the odds of
severe male-to-female physical aggression were more than 11 times higher on days of men’s
drinking than on days of no drinking.
Murphy et al. (2005) examined the relationship between proximal alcohol consumption and
intimate partner violence in a clinical sample of alcohol-dependent men. Results indicated
that alcohol consumption was present prior to both psychological and physical aggression,
yet the quantity of alcohol consumed by the husband was significantly higher prior to violent
conflicts. Not only was alcohol present during the vast majority of conflicts for this sample,
but alcohol was also a very common topic of conflicts, reported by over half of the
respondents for both violent and non-violent conflict events.
21"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:26","The impact of women’s drinking on domestic violence
There is some evidence that female victims of male-perpetrated violence are more likely to
be dependent on alcohol than non-victims (Miller, Wilsnack & Cunradi, 2000). Women who
report regular alcohol use or abuse have been shown to be between 2.2 and 3.4 times more
likely to be physically abused by their intimate partners than non-drinkers (Grisso et al.,
1999; El-Bassel et al., 2000). An Australian study of 267 substance-dependent women found
that 59 per cent (138 women) had experienced any physical or sexual assault as an adult, and
81 of these women had been sexually or physically assaulted by their partners. Of those
women who were assaulted by a partner, 24 per cent reported they were intoxicated at the
time of the assault and 59 per cent reported their partner was under the influence of alcohol
or other drugs (Swift, Copeland & Hall, 1996). Leonard (1993) identified associations
between wives’ excessive alcohol consumption and their husbands’ violence; however, after
controlling for husbands’ alcohol consumption, the relationship was no longer significant. In
another study of newlywed couples, wives’ heavy drinking did not emerge as a significant
predictor of husband aggression (Leonard, 1993). Taken together, there is mixed evidence
for a relationship between female heavy drinking and male-perpetrated physical violence.
Other research has examined whether women’s drinking is related to their own use of
physical aggression toward their partners. One US study found that couples who reported
any female alcohol-related problems were at significantly greater risk for female-to-male
violence than couples who reported no alcohol-related problems (Cunradi et al., 1999). A
secondary analysis of a national survey of youths aged 17 to 21 years (N = 808) found that
there was a stronger relationship between heavy drinking and fights after drinking in females
than in males (Wells et al., 2007). Another study conducted in the US found that among
perpetrators of domestic violence and irrespective of racial background, 15 to 22 per cent of
women who perpetrate violence against their partners reported drinking at the time of the
event (Caetano, Schafer & Cunradi, 2001). These findings suggest that alcohol may also
increase the risk for female-to-male physical aggression in women who drink heavily.
Taken together, there is evidence of an association between alcohol use and domestic
violence, and that the level of alcohol use relates to the level of violence; however, the
evidence regarding causation is certainly less clear cut.
Evidence relating to causality
In order to isolate factors predicting male-to-female marital violence, Leonard and Senchak,
(1996) followed for one year a sample of 541 newlywed couples. They measured several
plausible predictors of marital violence: alcohol problems and drinking levels; hostile
disposition; masculinity-femininity; perceived power imbalance; history of family violence;
and marital conflict style (problem-solving, verbal aggression and withdrawal). They took
into account premarital aggression of the husband as well as controlling for socio-
demographic and background factors of both partners (age, education, occupation, race-
ethnicity, religion, employment and parental status). They carried out a series of regression
analyses and concluded that higher levels of male-to-female marital violence could be
predicted in the first year of marriage by the verbal aggressiveness of both partners; low
withdrawal and high problem-solving conflict style of the husband; and where the husband
was a heavy drinker. As pointed out by the authors, the findings from this study with regard
22"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:27","to ‘low withdrawal’ and ‘high problem-solving conflict style’ are counterintuitive because it
may be expected that they would tend to improve family relationships.
From this research Leonard and Senchak (1996) suggest a number of plausible explanations
for the association between intimate partner or marital violence and heavy alcohol
consumption. They postulate that alcohol could lead to violence either because of (proximal)
cognitive disruption induced by alcohol, or because intoxication is being used as an excuse
for aggression. They suggest that violence could also result distally from the impact of the
behavioural or neuropharmacological consequences of heavy alcohol consumption, e.g.
hangovers, sleep deprivation, hypoglycaemia. Such explanations apply where alcohol is
considered a cause of domestic violence. However, other explanations can be made for the
association between marital violence and alcohol misuse. For example, intimate partner or
marital violence may itself lead to increased levels of alcohol consumption and the
persistence of alcohol dependence as a form of coping with relationship problems. Another
explanation is that intimate partner violence and alcohol use disorders are both caused by a
third factor, such as childhood learning/cultural factors, depression or biological factors.
Treatment studies provide some evidence of a causal relationship between alcohol use
disorders and intimate partner violence. Stuart et al. (2002) conducted an individual-based
treatment for alcohol-dependent women and their partners. At six and 12 months post-
treatment, decreases were found not only in alcohol use, but also in wife victimisation, wife-
to-husband marital violence, and wife-to-husband psychological abuse. In another treatment
study, O’Farrell et al. (2004) examined partner violence before and after behavioural couples
therapy (N = 303) for alcohol disorders in married or cohabiting alcohol-dependent males.
The study showed significant decreases in the prevalence and frequency of male-to-female
violence following treatment. These studies provide support for the notion that a causal
relationship may exist between alcohol use disorders and intimate partner violence, but they
do not exclude the possibility that other factors not assessed in these studies may account for
the changes identified at post-treatment.
In contrast to the aforementioned treatment studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis
by Gil-Gonzalez et al. (2006) found that the evidence regarding the association of alcohol
use with domestic violence was weak and may be biased due to preferential publishing of
studies with positive findings. They concluded that preventive policies for domestic violence
that address alcohol disorders alone may not be justified. Further, a follow-up study of a
randomly selected sample of nearly 1,400 married couples in the US could not demonstrate
evidence of an interaction between alcohol abuse and inter-partner violence as a cause of
marital separation after five years (Ramisetty-Mikler & Caetano, 2005).
In presenting the various arguments for and against the case that alcohol is a cause of
domestic violence, Nicholas (2005) argued that alcohol can be shown to be a factor but not a
major causal factor. Arguments for the notion of alcohol being a major causal factor often
refer to a loss of control by the perpetrator due to the disinhibition, blurred judgement, and
cognitive damage caused by alcohol abuse. However, such assertions can be contradicted by
several arguments made by Nicholas (2005). In particular there is little evidence of
perpetrators ‘losing control’ in any other aspect of their behaviour whilst drinking; e.g. they
do not tend to be particularly drunk when battering their wives and they also aim for parts of
the body where damage will not be visible to outsiders. Further, he argues that there is good
23"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:28","evidence that family violence does not require the presence of alcohol and, conversely, the
presence of alcohol does not necessarily involve any violence. Thus alcohol is not a
necessary or sufficient cause of domestic violence.
On the other hand, an Australian opinion piece by a clinical expert (McGregor, 1990) argues
that the basic cause of family violence is the personality and belief systems of the
perpetrator, and these better predict such violent behaviour. Thus internalised cultural norms
and beliefs about male behaviour whilst drinking play an important role in actual behaviours.
Research by Johnson (2001) provides support for this assertion. Her analysis of a large
Canadian survey found that when acting out of negative attitudes towards women was
entered into the equation, any association of alcohol abuse with domestic violence was
nullified. Other factors found to predict domestic violence included a belief that it is
sometimes acceptable to hit women, coming from a violent and substance abusing family,
low income and education, a belief that alcohol causes violence, and a desire for personal
power.
Conclusion
In an editorial on the impacts of alcohol use on inter-partner violence in the journal Addiction
(Leonard, 2005), Kenneth Leonard concluded that violent episodes are no more likely to
occur in the presence of alcohol, but when they do occur, they are associated with greater
severity. Thus treating the alcohol problem may not reduce the incidence of violence, but it
may reduce the harm associated with violent episodes.
Empirical evidence generally does not support the notion that alcohol abuse is a significant
cause of domestic violence. In fact it can be argued that use of alcohol as a reason for
violence encourages perpetrators and gives their victims a rationale for explaining and
forgiving violent behaviour. Nonetheless, the finding that treatment targeting alcohol abuse
is associated with reductions in domestic violence indicates that such treatment has utility.
Overall, changes in the prevalence of violent behaviour will only come about once cultural
and individual attitudes towards such behaviour are directly addressed. Thus it is
recommended that treatment providers assess and treat both alcohol use and co-occurring
aggression.
With regard to women, females who drink heavily appear more likely to engage in
psychological abuse and physical aggression toward their male partners. However, the
relationship is weaker than for male-to-female violence. There is some evidence that women
who abuse alcohol may be at greater risk of victimisation by their male partner or husband;
however, inconsistent findings mean that further research is needed to better understand this
relationship.
4.3 Impact on family life and functioning
4.3.1 Communication problems and family cohesion
Families with an alcohol-dependent or abusing parent are often more troubled and
dysfunctional than families not affected by parental alcohol problems. The home
24"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:29","environments of such families are characterised by communication problems such as deficits
in problem-solving capabilities, low familial congeniality (Haber & Jacob, 1997; Jacob, Krahn
& Leonard, 1991; Jacob, Leonard & Haber, 2001; Moser & Jacob, 1997) and poor family
cohesion (Bijttebier, Goethals & Ansoms, 2006; Jester et al., 2000).
The communication problems of families affected by parental problem drinking have been
documented in a number of studies using the Marital Interaction Coding System (MICS)
(Jacob et al., 2001). Investigators videotaped discussions amongst family members, and then
coded these discussions using the MICS. The MICS allows trained observers to classify
verbal and non-verbal communication into four summary categories: positive, negative,
problem-solving, and congeniality. The positive category consists of positive evaluations of
the speaker in regard to other family members (e.g. agreement and approval). The negative
category includes instances of negative evaluation (e.g. disagreement and criticism). The
problem-solving category consists of efforts made towards discussing and resolving
problems. Finally, the congeniality category reflects smiles, laughter and unrelated talking.
Results from studies that have used the MICS show that families affected by parental
problem drinking exhibit more negative communication, less positive communication, less
congeniality, and impaired problem-solving capabilities when compared with unaffected
controls (Haber & Jacob, 1997; Jacob et al., 1991; Jacob et al., 2001; Moser & Jacob, 1997).
These patterns have been documented in parent-child interactions, as well as in interactions
between spouses (Jacob et al., 1991; Moser & Jacob, 1997).
Problems in communication also appear to differ as a function of parental characteristics
other than drinking per se. For example, two studies examining the differential effects of
parent gender found that families affected by maternal alcohol misuse exhibited higher levels
of negative communication and lower levels of positive communication compared to both:
(a) families affected by paternal problem drinking alone; and (b) controls (Haber & Jacob,
1997; Moser & Jacob, 1997). In another study, families affected by marital distress in
conjunction with maternal alcohol misuse were shown to exhibit higher levels of negative
communication compared to families independently managing maternal problem drinking or
marital distress but not both (Kelly, Halford & Young, 2000). Studies have also found that in
families where paternal drinking (with no concomitant maternal alcohol misuse) is
accompanied by antisocial personality (Jacob et al., 2001) or aggression (Leonard & Roberts,
1998), communication is particularly impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that
factors such as parent gender, marital distress, and both paternal antisocial personality and
aggression might interact with parental alcohol misuse to compound impairments in family
communication. However, no causal associations between these constructs have been
established since none of the reported studies used longitudinal data, and there was
insufficient control for a range of possible confounding variables.
It remains possible that other factors associated with both alcohol and communication
problems (such as comorbid psychopathology, socioeconomic status, or education level)
explain these findings. Jacob et al. (1991) attempted to identify impaired communication
practices specific to families characterised by alcohol misuse by comparing families with an
alcohol misusing father (without any concomitant disorder such as depression), families with
a depressed father (without any concomitant alcohol use disorder), and families in which the
father exhibited no psychiatric or alcohol related disorder (control). Lower rates of
25"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:30","congeniality and problem-solving in father-child discussions were identified in both the
alcohol misusing and depressed groups relative to the control group. Jacob et al. (1991)
therefore suggested that a general distress factor (that would account for both alcohol
disorder and depression) may best explain impairment in parent-child communication, rather
than something unique to alcohol use disorders per se.
There are, however, some important methodological limitations that hinder the
interpretation of the findings described above. Sample sizes were often too small to achieve
adequate power (range of experimental group N = 15-50) and response rates were low.
Furthermore, very strict inclusion criteria were often necessary, such as the need for families
to be intact, and the screening of problem drinkers with any evidence of comorbid
psychological problems. These limitations preclude the generalisation of these findings to the
total population of alcohol misusing parents.
Several other studies have examined the cohesion of families affected by parental alcohol
misuse using the Family Environment Scale (FES). The FES is a self-report measure that
consists of 10 scales, including the Family Cohesion Scale, which measures the feeling of
support and togetherness within a family. Studies have administered the FES to caregivers
and children in examining the impact of parental alcohol problems on family cohesion and
organisation (Jester et al., 2000; Bijttebier et al., 2006). Both studies reported lower levels of
family cohesion and organisation among families characterised by parental alcohol use
problems (Jester et al., 2000; Bijttebier et al., 2006). These cross-sectional studies are unable
to determine causality, providing two possible explanations: (a) that low cohesion families
experience less support and vulnerable parents may be more likely to use alcohol as a
maladaptive coping mechanism; or (b) that alcohol misuse creates additional stressors which
interfere with maintaining trust, forgiveness and family cohesion (Scherer et al., 2012).
Another small study using the FES with Indigenous Australians (N = 99) found that despite
alcohol predicting high family conflict and aggression, there was no association between
family cohesion and alcohol misuse (Kelly & Kowalyszyn, 2003). Inconsistent findings
between these studies may be the result of methodological limitations, including low sample
sizes in the alcohol-affected groups, disparate cultural subgroups (i.e. Dutch families, African
American women and Indigenous Australians), and the low reported internal consistency of
the FES sub-scales in some studies (Bijttebier et al., 2006).
In summary, whilst parental alcohol use problems have been cross-sectionally associated
with poor family communication and cohesion in a number of studies, no evidence of
causality can at this stage be inferred based on the available literature. It would seem
plausible that there may be a general distress factor among alcohol-affected families that
contributes to poor communication and cohesion, but that this is not specific to alcohol-
affected families alone. Prospective research on parental alcohol use disorders and family
functioning is needed to untangle these complex pathways of influence.
4.3.2 Family violence
Families where one or both parents abuse alcohol are more likely than others to include
yelling, insults and serious arguments between family members, making the home an
26"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:31","unstable environment for children (Kumpfer & DeMarsh, 1985; Sher, 1991). As part of the
2002 NSDUH, data were collected from 68,126 respondents on the number of children in
the US living with substance-abusing or substance-dependent parents. Results indicated that
parents dependent on or abusing alcohol in the past year were significantly more likely to
report household turbulence than parents who did not have an alcohol use disorder
(SAMHSA, 2004). This household turbulence was defined as frequent insults, yelling, serious
arguments and threats of physical violence. In Scotland, 2.5 per cent of children
(N = 24,302) are estimated to live in households where violence had occurred after the
perpetrator had been drinking, and 1.2 per cent of children (N = 11,665) witnessed these
acts of violence (Manning et al., 2009). Studies have also shown that children as young as six
expect more verbal and physical aggression by an adult towards his/her spouse when the
adult is thought to be intoxicated versus sober (El-Sheikh & Elmore-Staton, 2007). Exposure
to family violence has been shown to have a range of effects on children’s development,
with both age and gender of the child being important; outcomes may include poor sleep
and health, externalising and aggressive behaviours, and internalising behaviours and
depression (Dawe et al., 2007).
Whilst these studies suggest that family violence may be a common feature of family life for
individuals affected by alcohol use disorders, much of the current Australian research on
problem drinking and family violence has focused on Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander
Australians and their experiences. Non-Indigenous studies on family violence have tended to
focus on intimate partner violence and child abuse, and are covered elsewhere in this review.
The term ‘family violence’ is often used by Indigenous people to refer to a broader
experience of violence than implied by the term ‘intimate partner violence’ (Stanley,
Tomison & Pocock, 2003). This broader experience includes physical forms of violence,
complemented by non-physical forms such as social, verbal, economic and psychological
violence. This also includes a broader range of potential perpetrators and victims, including,
for example, aunts, uncles, cousins, extended family members and the community more
generally (Blagg, 2000). This definition reflects the fact that within Indigenous culture the
victims and perpetrators of family violence may be an individual or a group, and that the
term ‘family’ means ‘extended family’ which covers a network of interconnected and trans-
generational kinship relationships (Memmott et al., 2001).
Reviews of family violence in Indigenous communities have shown that the incidence of
violence is disproportionately high when compared with non-Indigenous communities, and
that rates of violence are both escalating in frequency and becoming more serious in nature
(Memmott et al., 2001). In 2002, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social
Survey (NATSISS, N = 9,359) found that 21 per cent of Indigenous Australians aged 15
years and over reported that they felt family violence was a particular problem in their
community; family violence was seen as more of a problem in remote areas and in
overcrowded dwellings (ABS, 2004). Snowball and Weatherburn (2008) used this same
dataset to reveal that within the Indigenous population, high-risk alcohol consumption
doubles the rate of victimisation more than any other single factor, from 10.1 per cent to 20
per cent. Additional risk factors increased the likelihood of alcohol-related violence, such as
being a member of the stolen generation or exposure to financial stress, unemployment,
family breakdown and geographic or housing mobility (Snowball & Weatherburn, 2008).
Family violence in Indigenous communities is also often disproportionately directed towards
women, with Indigenous women 34 times more likely to be hospitalised for assault-related
27"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:32","injuries than non-Indigenous women (Bryant, 2009). Although some communities appear to
be less violent than others, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from all
communities identify violence as one of their greatest worries, and for many of these women
this violence was associated with alcohol consumption by the offender (Bolger, 1991).
The 2004 NDSHS (N = 463) found that approximately 38 per cent of urban Indigenous
Australians reported being victims of alcohol-related verbal abuse and 13 per cent were
victims of physical abuse (Al-Yaman, Van Doeland & Wallis, 2006). Moreover,
approximately 41 per cent of substance-related verbal abuse and nearly 20 per cent of
substance-related physical abuse experienced by Indigenous people was reported as being
perpetrated by relatives of the victims (Al-Yaman et al., 2006). Rates of Indigenous spouse
or partner homicides are 13 times more likely to be alcohol-related than non-Indigenous
intimate partner homicides (Dearden & Payne, 2009). Research indicates that within these
communities alcohol is a common factor which exacerbates the seriousness of the conflict,
rather than being the cause of violence (Memmott et al., 2001).
In their meta-analyses of the literature on family violence in Indigenous communities, Blagg
(1999) and Memmott (2001) both identified multi-causal models in which alcohol was one of
numerous situational factors underlying family violence. It has been suggested that the link
between alcohol misuse and violence in Indigenous communities is related to the concepts
of disinhibition, behavioural expectancies and ‘allowing’ violence to occur by providing a
socially accepted excuse for it, rather than being a direct causal mechanism (Hennessy &
Williams, 2001). For example, an individual may try to explain away antisocial behaviour by
using phrases such as: “I was drunk, I couldn’t help it”, “I didn’t know what I was doing”, or
“I don’t remember” (Bolger, 1991; Memmott et al., 2001). In support, Australian research
indicates that Indigenous offenders are significantly more likely to attribute their offending
to alcohol than non-Indigenous peers (Putt, Payne & Milner, 2005).
Whilst family violence and problem alcohol use appear to be particular problems in
Australian Indigenous communities, one is not a sufficient or necessary cause of the other.
This is evident by the fact that not all Indigenous people who use alcohol become violent;
while violence continues to occur in many alcohol-free Indigenous communities (Memmott
et al., 2001).
4.3.3 Organisation and routine
Families with an alcohol abusing parent have poorer organisation compared to families
unaffected by alcohol abuse (Tubman, 1993). This may be due to the fact that with
increasing patterns of abuse, substance dependence becomes the central organising principle
of the family at the expense of regular rituals and routines (Dawe et al., 2007). Family
systems theories identify organisation and regular activities, such as routines and rituals, as
the cornerstone of structure, predictability and stability for healthy families (Haugland, 2005).
As a result, it is likely that the maintenance of organisation, rituals and routine may serve as a
protective factor for families affected by parental problem drinking.
Empirical studies have indicated that problem drinking is commonly associated with
disruptions to everyday family routines. In one Australian longitudinal study (N = 260 male
28"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:33","adolescents and their parents), fathers’ heavy drinking was associated with rarely or never
eating dinner at home together (Cumes-Rayner et al., 1992). Furthermore, 89 per cent of
these sons reported that their families rarely or never spent evenings together, and 66 per
cent reported that their families never or rarely spent weekends together. Cumes-Rayner and
colleagues (1992) also found that families with heavy drinking fathers were more likely to
have heavy drinking sons and more difficulty settling disagreements at home, and surmised
that it was the sons who absented themselves from home activities rather than the fathers. In
a Norwegian study of 23 families, Haugland (2005) found that paternal problem drinking
was associated with disruptions to the structure of many every day events. These events
included family routines and rituals associated with mornings, meal times, bedtimes,
discipline, leisure activities and children’s social contact with their peers. However, this effect
was found to be largely displaced by the compensatory role of the non-problem-drinking
mother, who usually worked hard to maintain the structure of usual routines and rituals.
Empirical studies of parental problem drinking and family rituals and routines have been
limited by their exploratory nature, small sample sizes, lack of a control comparison group
and their focus on paternal drinking. Considering the central role of the mother in family
organisation, it is plausible that studies of maternal problem drinking, or families in which
both parents abuse alcohol, may find stronger associations between parental problem
drinking and disruptions to family organisation and routine. The extent to which these
disruptions impact on both family life and children is also likely to vary depending on the
presence of other risk factors such as marital conflict, family violence, separation or divorce,
and ambivalent and unpredictable parenting.
Research suggests that unpredictability and instability associated with a lack of routines and
rituals may contribute to maladjustment in children of problem drinkers, specifically, it may
contribute to children’s problem drinking in adult life, and an increase in anxiety-related
health disorders. A cross-sectional study (N = 68 couples) showed that family ritual
disruption is significantly associated with an increased risk of alcohol problems in adult
offspring of problem drinkers (Bennett et al., 1987). Bennett and colleagues found that
maintaining family rituals during periods of parental problem drinking appeared to protect
children from developing problems with alcohol later in life (Bennett et al., 1987). However,
in another study, Fiese (1993) found little evidence for an association between family rituals
and alcohol problems in adult offspring of problem drinkers. Rather, a strong association
was found between disruption of family rituals and an increased prevalence of anxiety-
related health disorders in these children later in life. It is important to note that families
dealing with problem drinking who are able to maintain routines and rituals may also be
distinguishable from those who are not by other characteristics, such as lower levels of
conflict, divorce or family violence (Fiese, 1993). These protective characteristics are also
likely to contribute to child adjustment, and to mediate or moderate the relationship between
child adjustment and a lack of routines and rituals associated with parental problem drinking.
Protective factors for children of problem drinking parents will be discussed in more detail
later in the chapter.
4.3.4 Financial strain
29"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:34","Anecdotal evidence suggests that money spent on alcohol is often not available for other
purposes like housing, rent or school fees (Tunnard, 2002). Children dealing with parental
problem drinking have spoken of the shortage of finances for clothes, food and bills, and of
their own money being borrowed in times of financial need (Tunnard, 2002). Living
conditions can also be poor, with large amounts of household financial resources directed
towards the procurement of drugs and alcohol (Tunnard, 2002). Health complications
commonly associated with alcohol abuse and dependence can also lead to medical costs
which have the potential to further increase the financial strains on families dealing with such
problems (Butterworth, 2003). To further compound these difficulties, alcohol problems are
more common in low-income single parent families, meaning that additional financial
pressures are commonly placed on families that have fewer economic resources to draw on
(CASA, 2005).
Australian data from the 1997 NSMHWB suggest that lone mothers who receive financial
assistance from the government are almost four times more likely than other mothers to
report alcohol and other substance use disorders (Butterworth, 2003). Women on welfare
who are dependent on alcohol or other drugs also report more barriers to employment than
women on welfare who do not have a substance use disorder. Barriers to employability
include domestic violence, mental health problems, legal problems, child welfare
investigations and fewer job skills (Morgenstern et al., 2003). These barriers decrease the
chances of alcohol- and substance-dependent women achieving the financial security often
associated with stable employment. However, financial strains can also impact on the
involvement of families in treatment because reduced or limited income often means that
these families cannot afford to receive treatment in private or specialised facilities. Families
where one or both parents have an alcohol-related problem may have reduced access to
treatment, or access to treatment that is inadequate to deal with the cluster of problems that
such individuals and their families typically experience (Mitchell et al., 2001).
Alcohol-related problems can also impede job performance, leading to reduced earnings or
loss of employment (Booth & Feng, 2002). In one Australian study of children of parents
who were engaged in a drug or alcohol treatment program in Victoria, it was found that 97.9
per cent of substance misusing parents were unemployed. Only 17 per cent of those
unemployed were actively seeking work, and the 2.1 per cent who were employed were all
employed on a part-time basis (Gruenert, Ratnam & Tsantefski, 2004). Of those families in
the study, 92.8 per cent also reported an annual household income of less than $20,000
($384 weekly) which primarily came from government social benefits payments (Gruenert et
al., 2004). This is low compared to the median Australian household income of $40,664
($782 per week) from the 2001 Census data (ABS, 2006). It is important to note, however,
that the numbers in this clinical sample were small (N = 118, comprising 48 children and 70
members of their extended families) and only 27.1 per cent were seeking treatment primarily
for alcohol. Another 48.9 per cent sought primary illicit drug treatment and had a secondary
problem with alcohol. The sample also most likely represented the more severe range of
drug and alcohol problems, with most of the adult participants having long histories of
substance dependency. A high proportion of the sample reported poly-substance use (79.2
per cent), multiple rehabilitation attempts (70.3 per cent had accessed a detoxification service
at least once), previous criminal offences (70 per cent), and low educational attainment (82.2
per cent had not completed Year 12) (Gruenert et al., 2004).
30"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:35","Large representative studies drawn from samples in the US have been more equivocal in
their findings regarding the association between problem drinking and employment. Mullahy
and Sindelar (1991; 1993), for example, found that problem drinking had a negative impact
on employment for both men and women in a large representative sample (N = 23,805). A
similar trend was identified in a later study (Mullahy & Sindelar, 1996); however, these results
were not found to be statistically significant. Another study of problem drinkers found that
there was no relationship between being an at-risk drinker and employment for women, and
only a small positive relationship was detected for men (Feng et al., 2001). As these studies
utilised cross-sectional designs it is possible that a range of other unmeasured characteristics
may account for the relationship between employment and problem drinking. Such
characteristics may include poor health status, low educational attainment or co-morbid
psychiatric problems (Booth & Feng, 2002).
Results from a longitudinal study conducted in six southern states of the US (N = 658)
found that individuals who indicated at initial interview that they drank seven or more drinks
on an average drinking day were six times more likely to be unemployed than those who did
not meet this criterion at the six month follow-up (Booth & Feng, 2002). Of those who were
working at follow-up, individuals who drank seven or more drinks per day were less likely to
be employed for as many weeks over a six month time period than participants who drank
less. The effect of heavy drinking on employment was found to be as important as the
influence of educational attainment, a major predictor of labour force status in most studies
(Booth & Feng, 2002). This association between employment and heavy drinking was found
after controlling for recent health status, negative life events and other drug use. Australian
data from the 2007 NSMHWB survey support this finding, showing that participants who
met criteria for alcohol abuse in the past 12 months were unable to perform, or had to cut
down on, normal activities for an average of 2.4 days out of the past 30, while those with
alcohol dependence reported 3.7 days out of role, compared to only 1.5 days for those with
no alcohol use disorder (Teesson et al., 2010).
Epidemiological studies have also explored the relationship between income and problem
drinking. Some studies have found positive relationships between alcohol consumption and
earnings (Berger & Leigh, 1988), whilst others have identified negative relationships (Feng et
al., 2001). It appears that the relationship between income and drinking depends on the
pattern of alcohol consumption under examination. When the focus is on moderate
drinking, it has been found that income increases are positively associated with alcohol
consumption (Berger & Leigh, 1988). Moderate drinkers also appear to earn more than their
non-drinking counterparts (Bryant, Sarnaranayake & Whilhite, 1993). However, when the
focus is on problem drinking, as defined by DSM-III alcohol use disorders, increased alcohol
consumption is associated with a significant reduction in earnings (Mullahy & Sindelar,
1993). However, as previously discussed, problem drinking is also related to employment. As
such, problem drinking may affect income indirectly by reducing employment, rather than
directly influencing the wages of workers (Feng et al., 2001).
Conversely, employment status may also have an influence on problem drinking. Life
transitions such as getting married and becoming pregnant are shown to reduce problem
drinking (as discussed elsewhere in this chapter). Becoming employed is also associated with
a decrease in alcohol dependence, specifically for older males, which Verges et al. (2012)
attribute to increased responsibility and structure. United States longitudinal data from the
31"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:36","National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)
(N = 34,653) also revealed increased work stress and increased financial resources can lead
to the onset and recurrence of alcohol dependence (Verges et al., 2012). This research
suggests that the effects of alcohol on employment, and vice versa, are likely to vary as a
function of age, sex and other life transitions/factors.
Clearly, the relationship between alcohol use and financial strain is multi-factorial. Financial
strain has, for example, been associated with a range of other factors likely to affect family
functioning including parental depression and negative parenting practices (Lyons, Henly &
Schuerman, 2005), child abuse and neglect (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000), and poor
parent-child interactions (Schiffman, Omar & McKelvey, 2003). It is likely that the link
between problematic alcohol use and financial strain is mediated by these kinds of factors. In
support, a cross-sectional study by Peirce et al. (1994) using structural equation modelling
(N = 1,424) found that depression mediated the relationship between financial strain and
drinking to cope, and similarly, drinking to cope mediated the relationship between
depression and alcohol consumption and problems (Peirce et al., 1994) In this study,
financial problems were independently associated with both depression and alcohol use, with
gender and race variables moderating the effect of these relationships. The direction of these
relationships are not clear; for example, financial problems and alcohol use may be
reciprocally related, where financial problems may increase depression and problem drinking
in the short term, or where problem drinking increases financial difficulties and depression in
the long term.
In summary, several lines of evidence suggest that families dealing with parental problem
drinking face significant financial strains. Anecdotal evidence suggests that financial strains
faced by families dealing with parental alcohol problems may be pervasive and severe.
Financial strain may limit access to treatment facilities, and may also be compounded by
alcohol-related medical costs. A variety of research evidence supports the relationship
between problem drinking and lower income, on the one hand, and reduced employability,
on the other; however, additional factors may be related to these associations rather than a
direct causal link between drinking and financial status. Therefore, further multivariate
research is needed to clarify the complex relationships between financial strain, alcohol use
and other factors.
4.3.5 Social isolation
Problem drinking has been shown to have a major impact on the social life of families.
Where a parent suffers alcohol dependence or problem drinking, spouses and children may
be isolated and less able to obtain support from social and health care support systems. The
value of community connectedness and social support for children is now recognised as a
protective factor against the development of future problems (Gruenert et al., 2004).
Community connectedness and social support can assist in the development of children’s
pro-social skills, enhance supervision, and promote positive self-esteem (Gilligan, 2000;
Fuller, 2001). Social isolation may therefore act as a risk factor for the maladjustment of
children dealing with parental alcohol misuse.
Tunnard (2002) suggests that children of problem drinkers have little time for social
activities because of the increased caregiving responsibilities and household duties they often
take on. Children of problem drinkers may also experience a feeling of shame about their
32"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:37","home circumstances (Boyd & Mackey, 2000), causing them to distance themselves from
other children and from adults such as teachers, who otherwise may be able to offer social
support (Tunnard, 2002). Children of problem drinkers also report more difficulties with
peer relationships including fewer friends to socialise with, lower confidence in making
friends, and avoidance by both their peers, and the parents of peers who discourage
friendships with such children (Tunnard, 2002). Additionally, house, school and
neighbourhood moves are often common for families of problem drinkers, making it
difficult for children to establish and maintain social connections and to engage with their
communities. In one study it was found that children of parents with severe drug and
alcohol problems had attended approximately two different schools, and moved house over
five times by the average age of 7.4 years (Gruenert et al., 2004). Extracurricular sporting and
recreation activities can be a good source of social support for children; however, due to the
financial strains often experienced by families dealing with parental problem drinking there
may not be enough money to afford participation in these kinds of activities (Gruenert et al.,
2004).
Psychosocial wellbeing is an important area of functioning that can be affected (both
positively and negatively) by alcohol use. With regard to social/leisure functioning, there is
fairly consistent evidence that older or elderly problem drinkers (both in and out of
treatment) tend to have social/leisure problems in the form of loneliness and low social
support (Schonfeld & Dupree, 1991), fewer social resources (Brennan & Moos, 1990), lower
social integration (Hanson, 1994), lower satisfaction with social relationships (Meyers et al.,
1982), social isolation, and fewer satisfying leisure activities (Graham, Carver & Brett, 1995).
A recent longitudinal study of 8,271 adolescents provided supporting evidence that drinking
predicted lower socio-emotional and academic functioning (Crosnoe, Benner & Schneider,
2012). However, the authors emphasised that the social context of drinking is significant in
the socio-emotional functioning of adolescents, whereby teen drinkers felt marginalised
within schools with dense networks of low-rate drinking. However, the inverse relationship
has also been found, where high socialisation has found to be associated with increased
drinking for male adolescents (Cumes-Rayner et al., 1992). This finding is also relevant for
adults, where expectations of social effects of alcohol and peer-network heavy drinking were
significant predictors of both husbands’ and wives’ own heavy drinking (Leonard & Homish,
2008). Thus, it appears that the social context and expectancies of drinking rather than
alcohol use per se are associated with negative impacts on individuals and families.
The low population density in rural Australia means that many of these Australians are faced
with social isolation. Whilst the potential for social isolation is likely to vary between rural
areas, individuals in these areas are at greater risk of social isolation due to the barriers
involved in getting together with others. NDSHS data from 2010 indicate that people living
in remote or very remote areas were more likely to drink at high levels for lifetime risk (30.5
per cent compared to 18.6 per cent in major cities) and also for single occasion risk (25.8 per
cent compared to 14.9 per cent in major cities) (AIHW, 2011a).
Australia’s Indigenous population is also over-represented in remote areas. The Indigenous
population comprises one per cent of the major cities population, eight per cent of regional
areas population and 58 per cent of remote areas population (AIHW, 2006). Alcohol abuse
in remote Indigenous communities has been associated with family problems as discussed
33"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:38","earlier in this chapter (Kowalyszyn & Kelly, 2003), and the effects of problem drinking are
also likely to be compounded by a lack of access to health and welfare services (Lester,
1994). Surprisingly, data from the 2004/05 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Health Survey (AIHW, 2011b) revealed that Indigenous adults in remote areas were more
likely to have abstained from alcohol consumption in the previous 12 months than those in
non-remote areas (38 versus 19 percent). The dates of this survey mean this finding cannot
be attributed to the restrictions on alcohol supply in some Indigenous communities which
occurred after 2008 (Elliott et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2012).
The difficulties of sampling and research in remote areas and the lack of representation in
epidemiological studies, as previously discussed, warrants further investigation to understand
the association between alcohol consumption and family problems in remote and rural
communities.
4.4 Comorbid mental health and substance use disorders
4.4.1 Prevalence and research on comorbid disorders
The co-occurrence of alcohol use disorders with other substance use disorders and with
psychological illnesses, including depression, anxiety, psychosis and antisocial personality
disorder, is frequently reported in epidemiological studies (e.g. Burns & Teesson, 2005;
Jablensky et al., 2000; Kessler et al., 1997; Teesson et al., 2000; Teesson et al., 2010). Those
with comorbid disorders often have poorer treatment outcome and worse course of illness
over time. This increases the risk of family problems and negative consequences on both
parents and children through increased impairment, social disability and burden of disease
(Hall, Degenhardt & Teesson, 2009). Many of the effects of parental alcohol use may also be
explained by mental health problems, which pose a significant challenge for identifying
causal relationships. It is important to understand the implications of comorbidity to
explicate alternative factors that may account for associations between alcohol use and family
functioning.
The 2007 NSMHWB (Teesson et al., 2010) provides national Australian data on the
prevalence of comorbid alcohol use disorders (using DSM IV criteria) with mental disorders
among Australian men and women, aged 16 to 85 years (N = 8,841). Results of the survey
indicated that in the previous 12 months, those with alcohol use disorders were over four
times more likely to have a comorbid mental disorder than those without an alcohol use
disorder. Of these, 20 per cent of all respondents with an alcohol use disorder met criteria
for one comorbid mental health disorder in the previous 12 months and 22.3 per cent met
criteria for two or more other disorders. Most commonly the secondary diagnosis was an
anxiety disorder (30.3 per cent) or other drug use disorder (16 per cent). Almost half (42.3
per cent) of those in Australia with an alcohol use disorder experienced mental health issues
during the 12 months prior, compared with only 14 per cent of the sample who had any
mental disorder but did not meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder (Teesson et al., 2010).
Furthermore, those with alcohol dependence were three times more likely to have comorbid
disorders than those with alcohol abuse.
The available international evidence also suggests that comorbidity is equally common
among people who are parents or who have significant responsibility for the care of children.
34"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:39","Clinical studies of alcohol-dependent or abusing parents have consistently demonstrated
elevated levels of depression, anti-social personality characteristics and general
psychopathology compared with non-alcohol-dependent or abusing parents (e.g. Eiden,
Chavez & Leonard, 1999; Giunta & Compas, 1994; Neff, 1994; Zucker et al., 1996). Few
general population studies on comorbidity have specifically examined comorbid substance
use in parents. However, statistics from the 2002 NSDUH show that in the US, parents who
reported alcohol dependence or abuse in 2001/02 were significantly more likely to have
smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs than parents who were not dependent on or had not
abused alcohol (SAMHSA, 2004).
In Australia there has been increasing awareness of the issue of dual diagnosis in parents
(Hegarty, 2004). Data show that comorbidity is common among parents of children in the
child protection system (Ainsworth, 2004; Hegarty, 2004). Statistics from the Department of
Human Services (DHS), Victoria show that among parents who reported alcohol abuse
problems in 2000/01, 51 per cent also reported other substance abuse problems, and 18 per
cent also had a psychiatric disability (DHS, 2002). Similarly, a parenting report from the
DHS (2003) found that in 2001/02, 62 per cent of parents with children in the welfare out-
of-home care system who reported a psychiatric disability also reported a substance abuse
problem, an increase from 50 per cent in 1997/98. To date, however, there are no
community data available on the prevalence of comorbid alcohol and mental health or
substance use disorders in Australian parents.
There are several possible reasons why comorbidity occurs. First, it has been postulated that
there is a direct causal relationship between these disorders, with the presence of one
disorder making the other more likely. For instance, a lack of effective or available
treatments for alcohol use disorders may contribute to the finding that only one in five
Australians seeks treatment (Teesson et al., 2010). Left untreated, alcohol abuse may lead to
higher levels of mental illness and other substance abuse by contributing to the inception,
recurrence or persistence of these mental disorders. Mental health disorders could also lead
to increased levels of alcohol consumption and the persistence of alcohol dependence as a
form of self-medication, or to relieve anxiety and stress (Hall et al., 2009). Alternatively, it is
possible that an indirect causal relationship exists, with one disorder affecting a third variable
in a way that increases the likelihood of the second disorder. For example, the presence of
early alcohol use problems may reduce the likelihood of successfully completing secondary
and tertiary education. Difficulties encountered due to poor educational attainment might
then increase the risk for other problems such as depression. Alternatively, it has been
postulated that there might be common determinants, environmental or genetic, that
increase the risk for both alcohol use disorders and other mental health disorders (Hall et al.,
2009). Recent reviews provide increasing evidence that the simple causal hypotheses may not
wholly explain the association. There is growing evidence from both longitudinal cohort and
twin studies that alcohol use disorders share many common risk factors and life pathways
with other substance use and mental health problems, and that these common risk factors
may explain the association (e.g. see Degenhardt, Hall & Lynskey, 2003; Teesson et al.,
2005a; Teesson et al., 2005b).
4.4.2 Poly-substance use
Poly-substance use is highly prevalent amongst those with alcohol use disorders and
35"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:40","compounds the potential negative effects of parental drinking on family functioning. As
examples, an Australian population study has shown that those diagnosed with an alcohol
use disorder are 10.5 times as likely to have a cannabis use disorder (Burns & Teesson, 2002)
and US data indicate that those with an alcohol use disorder are 36.3 times as likely to have a
cocaine use disorder (Regier et al., 1990). Longitudinal research in the US supports the
notion that these disorders may be causally related. The NESARC study (N = 34,653)
followed up participants after three years and determined that the presence of alcohol abuse
and drug abuse at baseline predicts alcohol dependence and drug dependence respectively
(Grant et al., 2009). However, this study did not look at the relationship between alcohol and
illicit drug use. The research on these associations has been limited by lack of reporting of
illicit drug use in the population and the tendency to exclude participants with comorbid
substance use from clinical treatment studies (Teesson et al., 2012).
As a result of the paucity of prospective studies the potential direction of any causal
relationship is not known. Some theories suggesting that licit drug use, i.e., alcohol and
tobacco, may begin a progression of drug use ending in illicit drug use, or alternatively that
illicit drug use may increase the likelihood of alcohol and tobacco use and dependence. A
third possibility is that comorbidity between substance use disorders may be attributable to
shared genetic predispositions and family environment which increases the chances of
alcohol and drug use disorders (Hall et al., 2009). These genetic and environmental factors
could also account for the high rate of alcohol use in children of parents who experienced
problem drinking.
4.4.3 Affective and anxiety disorders
Teesson et al. (2010) examined the prevalence of comorbidity between alcohol use disorders
and anxiety disorders using the 2007 NSMHWB data. Australians with an alcohol use
disorder were found to be almost three times more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety
disorder than those without an alcohol use disorder and 3.5 per cent of the sample met
criteria for combined affective, anxiety and substance use disorder (Teesson, Slade & Mills,
2009). The odds of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder were both significantly
increased in respondents with an alcohol use disorder. Burns and Teesson (2005) reported
that the co-occurrence of alcohol dependence and anxiety-related disorders (such as post-
traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and social phobia) was related to both increased
severity of alcohol dependence symptoms and increased treatment seeking.
An Australian private hospital drug and alcohol treatment sample (N = 104) revealed that
comorbid disorders were not significantly related to treatment attendance or self-report
measures of substance use (Dingle & King, 2009), where 92 per cent of the sample met
diagnoses for at least one other mental disorder, including major depression, generalised
anxiety, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Further evidence indicates that it was the
severity of depression symptoms at the nine-month follow-up which significantly predicted
fewer days abstinent from substance use in the past 30 days (Dingle & King, 2009).
Conversely, substance use has also been shown to increase the risk of affective disorders.
Ross and Dennis (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of 17 published studies, which revealed
that substance-using women reported significantly higher rates of postpartum depression
than control subjects, indicating that prenatal substance use predicted postpartum depression
36"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:41","symptoms. However, the authors acknowledge that this relationship may be mediated by
other socio-demographic risk factors.
While there has been consistent support for the relationship between anxiety disorders and
alcohol use disorders, these datasets offer conflicting evidence for the relationship between
alcohol use and affective disorders. The 2007 NSMHWB study found that those diagnosed
with an alcohol use disorder were no more likely than the rest of the sample to meet criteria
for a comorbid affective disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder (Teesson et al.
2010). In contrast, the previous survey in 1997 found that those with an alcohol use disorder
were four times more likely to have an affective disorder (Burns & Teesson, 2002). The
cross-sectional nature of these epidemiological studies means it is difficult to determine why
these results differ. These conflicting results may be attributed to changes in the
comorbidities of these disorders over time, or they may also suggest increased efficacy of
treatment for those with affective disorders, but not for those with anxiety disorders.
4.4.4 Psychotic disorders
The 1997 NSMHWB provided data on the Australian prevalence of psychotic disorders such
as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder. Although the one-month
prevalence of these psychotic disorders is low at 4.7 per 1,000 in an urban population, this
sample shows significantly increased rates of lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence, with
38.7 per cent of men and 17 per cent of women diagnosed with a psychotic disorder also
meeting criteria for lifetime a alcohol use disorder (Jablensky et al., 2000) These figures are
high when compared to 9.4 per cent of men and 3.4 per cent of women abusing alcohol in
the general population, as reported in the 1997 NSMHWB (Hall et al., 1998). People with a
psychotic illness are four times more likely to abuse alcohol than the general population and
30 per cent of respondents had a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (Jablensky et al.,
2000). The odds of alcohol dependence increase 1.5 times with each psychotic symptom
reported (Degenhardt, 2003).
International studies also provide evidence for significant comorbidity between alcohol use
disorders and schizophrenia. The Epidemiological Catchment Area Study (ECA) (Robins &
Regier, 1991), a large population based epidemiological study conducted in the US
(N = 20,291), reported a life time prevalence for alcohol dependence of 34 per cent in
people suffering schizophrenia (Regier et al., 1990). Studies have shown that alcohol use
disorders in this group are usually, but not always, secondary to the onset of schizophrenia
(Soyka, 2000).
4.4.5 Personality disorders
Epidemiological data from the US such as the ECA, NESARC, and the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS) a nationally representative household survey conducted in the
US (N = 8,098), show that personality disorders also commonly co-occur with alcohol use
disorders (Grant et al., 2008; Helzer & Pryzbeck, 1988; Kessler et al., 1997). NESARC data
indicate that for those who met lifetime criteria for BPD, 58.3 per cent also met a lifetime
diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder (Gianoli et al., 2012). While the causal links or factors
associated with these comorbid disorders is not well known, BPD traits are predictive of
future problems with alcohol use, and poor prognosis is observed for those with comorbid
37"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:42","BPD and alcohol use disorder compared to those with only one disorder (Gianoli et al.,
2012). Past 12-month alcohol dependence was reported in 18 per cent of cases and 50.7 per
cent reported substance use in the past 12 months, with greater prevalence amongst men
with BPD compared to women (Grant et al., 2008). When comorbidity was controlled for,
alcohol dependence remained significant but any association with alcohol abuse disappeared,
suggesting that these associations may be accounted for by factors common to both
disorders.
Similarly, parental antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and trait characteristics also appear
to be important in the relationship between parental alcohol dependence and family
functioning. Zucker et al. (1996) conducted a study in which alcohol-dependent fathers
(N = 311) were subtyped according to whether they had a high-level history of antisocial
behaviour during both childhood and adolescence or no sustained history of antisocial
behaviour. The researchers hypothesised that family risk would be greatest when the parents’
psychopathological risk structure had been in place across the lifespan. Results revealed that
antisocial alcohol-dependent fathers have denser family histories of alcohol use disorders,
lower intellectual functioning, and significantly higher levels of non-alcohol-related
psychopathology compared to non-antisocial alcohol-dependent fathers (Zucker et al., 1996).
Antisocial alcohol-dependent parents were also shown to display more aggressive behaviour
and conflict, and were lower in socioeconomic status than were the non-antisocial alcohol-
dependent parents and the control group.
Moss et al. (2001) compared mother-reported psychiatric disorders and problem behaviour
scores in pre-adolescent children with antisocial alcohol-dependent fathers, non-antisocial
alcohol-dependent fathers, and children whose fathers were without either disorder
(N = 639). Children from the antisocial alcohol-dependent group showed elevated rates of
major depression, conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder when compared to both other
groups of children. These children also had higher internalising and externalising problem
behaviour scores than the other two groups of children; there were no significant differences
between children with non-antisocial alcohol-dependent parents and controls. Hussong and
colleagues (2007) integrated the analyses of two independent longitudinal studies (N = 1,050
adolescents and at least one or both of their parents), which used a high risk design to assess
children with subtypes of alcohol-dependent parents (alcoholism only, alcoholism and
depression, and alcoholism and ASPD) and compared them with depressed parent-only
controls on their externalising behaviours, measured by the aggressive and delinquent
behaviour sub-scales on the Child Behaviour Checklist and Youth Self Report. Consistent
with the aforementioned findings, children whose parents were both diagnosed with alcohol
disorders and those whose parents had comorbid alcohol use disorder and depression were
found to exhibit greater externalising symptoms than children whose parents were only
diagnosed with depression. Hussong et al. (2007) discuss this as evidence for an inter-
generational susceptibility for developing antisocial characteristics with a risk of later
development of adult alcoholism.
4.4.6 Impacts of comorbidity on families
While the nature of the temporal and causal relations between alcohol abuse and other
38"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:43","mental illnesses are complex, there is overwhelming evidence for the negative effects of
comorbidity. Comorbidity is associated with more severe symptoms of alcohol dependence
and significantly increased disability in everyday functioning (Burns & Teesson, 2002; Burns
& Teesson, 2005). Comorbidity is also associated with severe illness course, greater service
utilisation, non-compliance with treatment regimes and high rates of re-hospitalisation.
Alcohol use disorders complicated by other drug and mental health disorders, and vice versa,
have been recognised as having poorer prognosis than those without such comorbidity
(Burns & Teesson, 2002; Drake & Mueser, 2002; Teesson & Proudfoot, 2003; Hall et al.,
2009).
To date, most studies on the effects of parental alcohol and mental health problems on
children and family life have proceeded in isolation from one another; however, a small body
of research has examined the impact of both alcohol and other comorbid mental health
disorders. For example, Ohannessian and colleagues (2004) examined the relationship
between parental alcohol dependence with and without comorbid psychopathology, and
adolescent psychopathology, using a sample of 13 to 17-year-old adolescents and their
parents (N = 665). Results indicated that parent comorbid psychopathology had a
considerable impact on adolescent adjustment. Adolescents who had parents diagnosed with
alcohol dependence and either comorbid drug dependence or depression were significantly
more likely to exhibit higher levels of psychological symptomatology than adolescents whose
parents reported alcohol dependence only, or depression only. Moreover, adolescents whose
parents were diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depression as well as drug dependence
were most likely to exhibit psychological problems. The results suggest that much of the
existing literature on children of parents with alcohol use disorders may be a result of
comorbidity rather than parental alcohol use alone; however, in many of these studies
comorbidity is not controlled for (Ohannessian et al., 2004).
Eiden et al. (1999) examined the role of parental comorbid psychopathology in a study on
the links between father’s alcohol dependence and parent-infant interaction quality
(N = 204). The study found that paternal alcohol dependence was associated with other risk
factors for the father, including depression, antisocial behaviour and family aggression.
Fathers’ depression was found to mediate the relationship between paternal alcohol
dependence and lower paternal sensitivity during parent-infant interactions. Similarly,
maternal depression mediated the relationship between maternal alcohol problems and lower
sensitivity resulting in more negative parent-infant interactions. Although only a small
number of problem-drinking mothers were included in the sample, these results suggest that
the co-occurrence of alcohol use disorders and other mental health problems are likely to
negatively impact on children early in life.
In summary, the specific ways in which comorbidity impacts on family life are likely to vary
as a function of the type and severity of comorbid mental health problem experienced by a
parent. What is clear, however, is that families where one or both parents suffer comorbid
mental health and alcohol use disorders are at high-risk for a range of negative outcomes. It
is likely that many of the harms discussed in this review, such as family conflict and violence,
economic difficulties, disruptions to parenting, and mental health problems in children, are
worse within the context of comorbid mental health problems. Given that the majority of
people dependent on or abusing alcohol typically report at least one additional lifetime
psychiatric disorder, further research is needed in Australia to ascertain the prevalence of

4.5 Impact on parenting
4.5.1 Disrupted parenting
Research indicates that parenting is often disrupted in families where one or both parents are
problem drinkers. Theory suggests that alcohol interferes with a parent’s ability to be
consistently warm, supportive and available during parent-child interactions (Jacob &
Leonard, 1994). It has also been posited that stressful environments and other factors such
as parental psychopathology, socioeconomic disadvantage and social isolation, may
contribute to the risks for both alcohol use and disrupted parenting (Dawe et al., 2007).
Disrupted parenting subsequently impacts negatively on the quality of the parent-child
relationship, which is thought to be the foundation of effective parenting. In this way,
specific parenting practices and the quality of the parent-child relationship have been
proposed to be closely interrelated (Dishion & McMahon, 1998).
Cross-sectional studies show that family environments where one or both parents abuse
alcohol may be characterised by lack of stability and consistency in parenting (Windle, 1996;
Johnson & Leff, 1999), lack of parental warmth and nurturance (Hayes et al., 2004; Jacob &
Leonard, 1994), attachment problems between parents and children (Eiden et al., 1999;
Eiden, Edwards & Leonard, 2002), and poor monitoring and socialisation (Guo et al., 2001).
Increasing evidence from prospective studies also suggests that parental alcohol abuse and
dependence have a negative impact on a range of parenting practices (Eiden et al., 2002;
Guo et al., 2001; Hayes et al., 2004). The recent empirical literature on the relationship
between alcohol use disorders and disruptions in parenting is reviewed below.
Lack of parental nurturance
Parental nurturance, or support, has been identified as a salient influence on childhood and
adolescent outcomes, especially with regard to adolescent alcohol use and mental health
outcomes (Jacob & Leonard, 1994; Hayes et al., 2004). Parental nurturance is characterised
by parenting behaviours that demonstrate caring and acceptance of the child and may
include such things as being actively involved in the child’s life and encouragement of the
child’s activities. Deficits in parental support are common in parents who drink heavily, and
have been linked both cross-sectionally and longitudinally to a number of negative outcomes
in children, including adolescent substance abuse (Chassin et al., 1999; Johnson & Leff,
1999; Lynskey, Fergusson & Horwood, 1994).
Parent-infant attachment stability and the quality of interactions between parent and child
overlap to some extent with the construct of parental nurturance. This literature is discussed
in the following two sections focusing on infant attachment and parent-infant relationships
to examine parental nurturance in families where one or both parents abuse alcohol.
40"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:45","Parent-child interaction problems and infant attachment insecurity
A small body of research has explored the nature of parent-child interactions and infant
attachment security in alcohol-abusing or alcohol-dependent fathers and their families. Both
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show that parent-child interactions and infant
attachment security are frequently disrupted in families affected by paternal alcohol
problems, particularly when multiple risk factors are present, including parental depression,
antisocial behaviour and family conflict, and aggression (Eiden et al., 1999; Eiden et al.,
2002). Infants in families with two parents with an alcohol problem have been demonstrated
to have significantly higher rates of insecure attachment with both parents (Eiden et al.,
2002). Changes in parenting style during active substance use have also been shown to result
in many parents becoming irritable, intolerant, inattentive and demonstrating unpredictable
behaviour and mood swings. The children experiencing these parental behaviours often
became socially withdrawn and hypersensitive to their parents’ moods (Dawe et al., 2007).
Using a prospective design, Eiden et al. (2004) examined the nature of parent-infant
interactions in families (N = 222) affected by alcohol abuse across time. The study compared
parent-child interactions among high-risk families characterised by paternal alcohol
dependence, with a demographically matched non-alcohol-dependent control group.
Assessments were conducted at 12, 18 and 24 months of child age. The quality of parent-
infant interactions was assessed by the level of positive paternal and maternal involvement,
sensitive responding and positive/negative effect. The level of infant responsiveness was
determined by the level of child positive/negative effect and responsiveness to parental
behaviour. Results indicated that higher paternal alcohol consumption at 12 months
prospectively predicted both negative paternal and maternal behaviour at 24 months. The
direction of influence for both mother-infant and father-infant interactions was from parent
to child; infant behaviour was not shown to predict parental behaviour across time. These
findings suggest that one important pathway to risk in children of alcohol-dependent fathers
is through negative parent-infant interactions.
In another study on this sample (N = 217), Edwards, Eiden and Leonard (2004) examined
the relationship between paternal alcohol use disorders and consistency of infant attachment
security from 12 to 18 months infant age. The study found that higher paternal and maternal
alcohol symptoms, maternal depression and maternal antisocial behaviour were characteristic
of families with insecure mother-infant attachment from 12 to 18 months. The study also
examined the quality of parent-infant play interactions relative to consistency in insecure
attachment classification. Results indicated that mother-infant insecurity was associated with
higher levels of maternal negative affect during play interactions. Similarly, father-infant
stable insecurity was associated with lower levels of paternal positive affect and decreased
sensitivity during play interactions. The study indicated that infants who were classified
insecure at both time points had the highest constellation of family risk characteristics,
including parental alcohol use.
Taken together, these studies indicate that the origins of risk for later maladjustment among
children of alcohol-dependent fathers may be detectable in infancy. These findings suggest
that an important pathway to risk in children of alcohol-dependent fathers is through
negative parent-infant interactions. Negative parent-infant interactions were also shown to
be associated with persistent patterns of insecure mother and father-infant attachment across
41"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:46","time, providing further support for the theoretical link between parent-infant interactions
and attachment security (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). These studies highlight that
children at greatest risk are those from families in which there is a constellation of family
risks, and that many of these factors exert their influences in indirect ways. Further
longitudinal research is needed to understand the complex links between parental alcohol
problems, parent-infant interactions, infant attachment style, and other early risks.
Parent-child relationship problems
Given that parent-infant attachment insecurity, parent-child interaction problems, and low
nurturance are linked to parental alcohol use, it is perhaps not surprising that parent-child
relationship problems are also common. A number of parent-child relationship difficulties
have been noted in the literature as occurring more frequently among families with an
alcohol abusing parent including increased conflict, increased family stress, emotional or
physical violence, decreased family cohesion and lack of organisation (Johnson & Leff, 1999;
Timko, Kaplowitz & Moos, 2000). Additionally, studies have found that families
characterised by parental alcohol misuse interact in a more negative way (defined by the use
of criticism and disagreement), when compared to families with no parental alcohol misuse
(Moser & Jacob, 1997).
Timko and colleagues (2000) conducted an eight-year follow-up study (N = 466), which
examined child-parent relationships among families where either the mother or father had
entered a detoxification program for problem drinking at baseline. The results of this study
identified an important gender difference. Specifically, greater relationship satisfaction for
mothers with their child at baseline, one year and three years, was related to lower alcohol
consumption and an improved psychological state at the subsequent follow-ups (Timko et
al., 2000). Fewer and less consistent associations were identified in child-father relationships,
despite comparable levels of drinking problem severity at baseline. These gender differences
indicate that different intervention strategies may be needed; where family-oriented
interventions may work best for problem-drinking mothers, fathers may do better if
interventions are designed directly at alleviating the problem drinking (Timko et al., 2000).
The quality of parent-child relationships has been shown in longitudinal studies to be
associated with poorer adolescent outcomes, including adolescent drinking, both directly
(Bray et al., 2001) and indirectly, through the impact on parental monitoring and the
development of deviant peer associations (Ary et al., 1999a; Ary et al., 1999b; Barnes et al.,
2000; Essau & Hutchinson, 2008). Positive parent-child relationships have been shown to
have a protective effect on children’s drinking behaviour, with delayed alcohol initiation and
reduced levels of later drinking observed (Ryan, Jorm & Lubman, 2010). The literature on
poor parental monitoring will be discussed in the following section.
Poor monitoring and socialisation
Parental monitoring encompasses a number of behaviours, including parental awareness and
supervision of adolescent activities, which may involve friendship groups, school or their
behaviour at home (Essau & Hutchinson, 2008), as well as establishing firm but supportive
42"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:47","behavioural limits and boundaries (Dawe et al., 2007). Parental monitoring also refers to the
ability of the parent to communicate their concern for, or their awareness of, the above
activities to the adolescent (Essau & Hutchinson, 2008). Poor parental monitoring is
characteristic of families affected by parental alcohol misuse because they often lack
parenting and family communication skills (Johnson & Leff, 1999). Findings from the Seattle
Social Development Project indicated that permissive parental monitoring at child age 10
years was an important predictor of alcohol abuse and dependence at age 21 years (Guo et
al., 2001). This longitudinal study of 808 students found that even after both externalising
and internalising behaviours (at 10 years of age) were controlled for, close parental
monitoring predicted lower risk for alcohol abuse and dependence at 21 years of age (Guo et
al., 2001). Other longitudinal studies have demonstrated similar results, indicating the
importance of establishing and maintaining close parental monitoring during childhood and
adolescence (Ary et al., 1999a; Ary et al., 1999b; Barnes & Farrell, 1992; Barnes et al., 2000;
Guo et al., 2001; Simons-Morton & Chen, 2005; Thomas et al., 2000).
Alcohol abusing and alcohol-dependent parents also tend to engage in fewer family activities
with their children (Johnson & Leff, 1999). A longitudinal twin study (N = 4,731) found that
parent socialisation (i.e., the degree to which parents and children engage in shared activities)
influenced adolescent alcohol use indirectly through the development of negative parenting
practices (Latendresse et al., 2008). Frequencies of parental alcohol use and intoxication were
negatively associated with adolescents’ perceptions of shared activities and monitoring, and
positively associated with perceived relational tension and discipline. Poor monitoring was
linked to increased adolescence drinking at age 14 years, while increased discipline was
associated with adolescent drinking at age 17.5 (Latendresse et al., 2008). Additionally, a
study of families in which parental alcohol abuse was a problem, found that parental
drinking produced repeated disruptions to family routines in a range of settings, including
dinner, bedtime, discipline practices and leisure activities (Haugland, 2005). Disruptions were
typically found in respect to the fathers’ participation in routines, and were seen to create an
unpredictable environment for the children involved, which weaken family cohesion
(Haugland, 2005).
Parentification
The literature on alcohol use disorders and family functioning has highlighted the
accommodating roles that family members may take on to protect and compensate for the
alcohol-dependent parent. Evidence suggests that parents who abuse alcohol sometimes
abdicate their parenting roles, leaving children to take on roles and responsibilities that are
inappropriate for their age (Chase, Deming & Wells, 1998; Dawe et al., 2007; Godsall et al.,
2004; Kelley et al., 2007). The behaviours of family members close to an alcohol-dependent
parent have often been described as ‘co-dependent’ because the family organises around the
needs or demands of the dependent parent. In taking care of an alcohol-dependent parent,
children may demonstrate a range of parentified behaviours, from overt physical care of the
parent, to covert methods of caretaking demonstrated by emotionally comforting or
protecting the parent, in addition to taking care of younger siblings.
Chase, Deming and Wells (1998) examined 360 young adult children of alcohol-dependent
parents in terms of their perceptions of having assumed a parentified role in their family.
43"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:48","Respondents who had an alcohol-dependent parent scored higher on the Parentification
Questionnaire, a measure of caretaking responsibility, than peers who were either children of
problem drinkers or children of non-alcohol-dependent parents. Retrospective studies have
also identified an association between parentification and parental alcohol misuse (Kelley et
al., 2007), with gender differences revealing that daughters of alcohol-misusing mothers
reported greater parentification than daughters of alcohol-misusing fathers.
Despite these findings, it has not been established whether these parentified behaviours
develop as a consequence of parental drinking, or whether they result from other problems
in parenting and family functioning that co-occur with parental alcohol abuse and
dependence. Parentification has been observed in studies of both parental drinking and also
marital aggression and conflict, suggesting that there could be common determinants of
these behaviours (Keller et al., 2011). Additionally, although the negative consequences of
parentification have been documented, there are suggestions in the literature that
parentification can have positive effects in terms of developing a sense of competence and
self-concept, conditional upon the parent offering support and positive feedback (Barnett &
Parker, 1998; Godsall et al., 2004). Parentification is a complex phenomenon, however, and
the effects, whether positive or negative, are dependent on a range of individual, situational
and family factors (Barnett & Parker, 1998; Chase et al., 1998).
Child abuse
The empirical literatures on parental alcohol use disorders and child abuse have generally
proceeded in isolation from each other. However, there is an increasing body of research
indicating that parental drinking problems are associated with child emotional, physical and
sexual abuse. Studies of clinical, substance abuse, support group and convention samples
have identified elevated rates of childhood sexual and physical abuse in adults who also
reported parental alcohol abuse or dependence in childhood (Ackerman & Gondolf, 1991;
Kerr & Hill, 1992; Kotch et al., 1999; Windle et al., 1995).
Alcohol use disorders have been shown to occur at particularly high rates among parents of
children who enter child protection services in Australia (Ainsworth, 2004; Ainsworth &
Summers, 2001; Laslett et al., 2010; Laslett, Dietze et al., 2012a; Tomison, 1996). Estimates
based on Victorian child protection cases indicate that up to a third of all parents involved in
substantiated child abuse or neglect cases in Australia in 2000/01 experienced alcohol abuse
(Dawe et al., 2007). Tomison (1996) reported on a large-scale tracking study of suspected
child abuse and neglect cases (N = 295) involving a number of agencies in a Victorian
regional child protection network. A valid case of child abuse or neglect was defined as any
suspected case of child abuse or neglect where there was sufficient concern to investigate,
refer and/or treat or counsel the child. Results indicated that in 25.8 per cent of suspected
cases of child maltreatment, workers identified at least one caregiver in the family as having
an alcohol problem. Further analyses indicated that an alcohol problem was identified in 40
per cent of physical abuse cases, 31.3 per cent of emotional abuse cases, 28 per cent of
neglect cases, and in 16.9 per cent of sexual abuse cases. Additionally, a report by the
Department of Community Services estimated that during the 2004/05 reporting period up
to 80 per cent of child protection reports involved drug or alcohol abuse (Burke, Schmied &
Montrose, 2006).
44"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:49","National statistics on child maltreatment also show that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
children are significantly overrepresented in most statutory child protection reports of abuse
or neglect (Stanley et al., 2003). Based on notifications to child protection departments
around Australia in 2001/02 (AIHW, 2003), 3,254 Indigenous children under 17 years had
some form of abuse substantiated. This rate of substantiation was on average 4.3 times
higher for all types of abuse in the Indigenous population than in the non-Indigenous
population. These departmental child protection figures are likely to be an underestimate of
the actual levels of child maltreatment because they are based on reported child abuse and
neglect only.
Alcohol abuse is considered to be an important situational factor in determining child abuse
and neglect (Memmott et al., 2001). This is supported by evidence of a strong, repeatedly
demonstrated relationship between alcohol and drug abuse and violence in Indigenous
communities (Atkinson, 1991; Bolger, 1991; Fitzgerald, 2001; Robertson, 2000). In fact, a
government inquiry examining Indigenous communities throughout the Northern Territory,
found a strong relationship between alcohol abuse and child sexual abuse (Wild & Anderson,
2007). As described earlier in this review, it has been suggested that alcohol may facilitate or
incite family violence by providing a socially acceptable excuse for the negative behaviour
(Robertson, 2000). It has also been argued that alcohol abuse is correlated with numerous
other risks for child abuse in Indigenous communities, including historical circumstances
(e.g. trauma, loss of culture and community), violence, unemployment and welfare
dependency (Memmott et al., 2001; Stanley et al., 2003). To date, the lack of prospective data
means that causal links between alcohol and child abuse cannot be determined.
Despite the documented association identified between parental alcohol use problems and
child abuse within high-risk and Indigenous samples, international studies that have
retrospectively examined this relationship in community samples have produced inconsistent
findings. For example, Harter and Taylor (2000) examined the long-term adjustment of
college students (N = 333) with and without childhood histories of both parental alcohol
dependence and sexual, physical or emotional abuse. The study found no significant
differences in the incidences of child abuse among adults with or without childhood histories
of parental alcohol disorders. However, further analyses indicated that adults exposed to
both parental alcohol use disorders and emotional abuse in childhood had the poorest adult
functioning in school and work roles. In comparison, individuals who were exposed to
parental alcohol dependence but with no history of child abuse had the highest functioning
in these areas. Harter and Taylor (2000) suggest that these findings show the heterogeneity in
outcomes commonly found among adults exposed to parental alcohol problems and
childhood abuses, including clinical observations that some adults exposed to parental
alcohol abuse may develop high adaptive skills (Brown, 1998). These results are also
consistent with a growing body of research indicating that family dysfunction plays a key role
in the relationship between parental alcohol use disorders and adult outcomes (Jacob &
Leonard, 1994).
Dube et al. (2001) also used a retrospective community-based design of 8,629 adult
participants to examine the association between parental alcohol abuse and multiple forms of
childhood abuse, neglect and other household dysfunction, including domestic violence
towards the mother. Compared to persons who grew up with no parental alcohol abuse, the
45"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:50","likelihood of adverse childhood experiences was between two and 13 times higher if the
mother, or father, or both parents abused alcohol. In families where both parents abused
alcohol, the likelihood of emotional abuse increased four-fold, the likelihood of physical
abuse increased three-fold, and the likelihood of sexual abuse in women increased three-fold.
For almost every adverse childhood experience examined in the study, those who grew up
with both an alcohol-abusing mother and father had the highest likelihood of multiple
adverse childhood experiences. The study concluded that although the retrospective
reporting of these experiences cannot establish a causal association, exposure to parental
alcohol abuse was highly associated with experiencing childhood maltreatment or household
dysfunction.
Smith and colleagues (2007) explored prenatal and postnatal substance use in a sample of
117 foster children recruited from a local child welfare system to explore the influence of
maternal and paternal substance use on child maltreatment and foster care placements.
Prenatal maternal alcohol use was a predictor of postnatal maternal substance use, as well as
a risk for mothers to become involved with a substance-using partner. They also found that
postnatal paternal alcohol and drug use was related to a higher likelihood of child
maltreatment and a key risk factor for children to experience multiple foster care placement
transitions, compared to children of non-substance using parents. However, this study found
no relationship between postnatal maternal substance use and child physical abuse,
acknowledging the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of information on parental
substance use from the child welfare case files. A number of studies have provided some
support for the hypothesis that postnatal alcohol use contributes to child maltreatment;
however, there are no conclusive findings that implicate alcohol use in negative child
outcomes (Widom & Hiller-Sturmhofel, 2001).
Locke and Newcomb (2003) examined how different types of child maltreatment relate to
parental drug and alcohol problems in a community sample of adults (N = 477). The
childhood maltreatment measure included assessment of emotional, physical and sexual
abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect. Findings suggested that childhood
maltreatment and parental drug and alcohol problems are two distinct but interrelated
conditions that co-occur about 30 per cent of the time for males, and about 20 per cent of
the time for females. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that these problems are not
completely independent, nor are they always related to each other. When these problems co-
occurred, increased global levels of parental dysfunction were identified. However, the
inclusion of participants exposed to both parental drug and alcohol problems meant that the
relative influence of parental alcohol and drug problems could not be determined.
Taken together, evidence suggests that the relationship between parental alcohol use
disorders and child abuse is not straightforward. Although there is an association between
these problems in high-risk and Indigenous groups in Australia, findings have been less
consistent in community samples. It may be the case that there are other shared risks that
account for the co-occurrence of these problems. For example, there is some evidence that
parental alcohol problems and childhood abuse are more likely to co-occur in families
characterised by poor functioning, low socio-economic status and other psychosocial risks
(Memmott et al., 2001; Widom & Hiller-Sturmhofel, 2001). This makes it difficult to
determine whether parental alcohol abuse actually increases the risk of child abuse, or
whether other factors better explain the association.
46"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:51","Inconsistent findings in the literature may also be due to limited control for sampling biases,
particularly in treatment-seeking and convention samples (Harter, 2000). It has been argued
that adults with a childhood history of parental alcohol use disorders who seek help may
have more frequently experienced abuse in childhood (Harter & Taylor, 2000). This is
consistent with the finding that help-seeking individuals are more distressed and socially
maladjusted than college students or non-treatment-seeking community samples (Ackerman
& Gondolf, 1991; Kashubeck & Christensen, 1992; Mintz, Kashubeck & Tracy, 1995;
Wright & Heppner, 1993). Similarly, studies on children within the welfare system focus on
those with the most severe impairments, meaning that the influence of parental alcohol use
is likely to be confounded by other factors affecting poor functioning families. Conversely,
the use of community and college samples is likely to result in the exclusion of poorer
functioning families with the most severe impairments, providing an underestimate of the
incidence of co-occurring child abuse and parental alcohol abuse.
Based on present findings, it is concluded that parental alcohol use disorders are associated
with a small to moderate increase in risk for child abuse. The extent and pervasiveness of
parental alcohol exposure, and the presence of a range of other risks, both appear to
influence the risk for child abuse. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that
alcohol problems directly lead to child abuse. More research is needed to understand the
shared and specific dimensions of parental alcohol use disorders and abusive experiences to
assist in the development of integrative models that guide prevention and treatment efforts.
4.5.2 Parental attitudes towards drinking and modelling of alcohol use
Parental attitudes toward drinking
Parental attitudes toward drinking represent an indirect means of social modelling (Williams
& Hine, 2002) and may be communicated either overtly or tacitly through the setting of
limits or communication of values regarding alcohol use by parents. Research has found that
parents who drink alcohol are more likely to exhibit permissiveness toward alcohol use in
their adolescent children (Hayes et al., 2004; Wood et al., 2004). Parents’ permissiveness
regarding alcohol use may therefore be influential in determining adolescent alcohol
initiation and the later transition to heavier drinking. It is important to also note that parental
attitudes are dynamic and are likely to change with adolescent development (Hayes et al.,
2004). Smith and Rosenthal (1995) found that adolescent perception of parental approval of
drinking decreased as age increased. The literature examining the relationship between
parental attitudes and age is, however, limited (Hayes et al., 2004).
Wood et al. (2004) examined the role of parental permissiveness in the prediction of alcohol
use in a sample of late adolescents. The study found that the more permissive parents were
in regard to adolescent alcohol use, the more likely their adolescents were to engage in heavy
binge drinking. Parental permissiveness also appeared to influence peer associations, with a
significant relationship between peer influence and alcohol use demonstrated when parents
were permissive.
47"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:52","Williams and Hine (2002) assessed the role of parental attitudes towards adolescent alcohol
use in mediating the role of more global parental permissiveness in the prediction of alcohol
misuse among adolescents living in rural Queensland (N = 320). The study found that
parental permissiveness and both mothers’ and fathers’ level of alcohol use were indirectly
related to adolescent misuse, as they were mediated by parental and significant others’ level
of approval of the adolescent’s alcohol use. The findings of this study suggest that parental
permissiveness towards alcohol use has a more influential role in determining adolescent
alcohol misuse than more general parental permissiveness. Parental permissiveness towards
alcohol use was also shown to be more likely in families where parents drink alcohol, and
was also associated with more positive attitudes in adolescents toward alcohol consumption
and higher levels of anticipated social reinforcement from significant others (Williams &
Hine, 2002).
While current research indicates that Australian parents continue to show a lack of
knowledge about the NHMRC guidelines for reducing the health risks of drinking and the
parenting guidelines for adolescent alcohol use, many parents report adopting harm
minimisation strategies with their children (Gilligan & Kypri, 2012). Some research has
shown that adolescent drinking is influenced by parents providing clear alcohol-specific rules
(Wood et al., 2004; van der Vorst et al., 2005; van der Vorst et al., 2007; Van Zundert et al.,
2006). For instance, van der Vorst and colleagues (2007) assessed parental alcohol-specific
socialisation and adolescent alcohol use among 428 families (both parents and two
adolescents were interviewed in each family). This study found that the likelihood of
drinking initiation was reduced if clear alcohol-specific rules were provided, and this was
demonstrated regardless of the age of the adolescent. This study did observe, however, that
the impact of alcohol-specific rules declines once the adolescent has an established drinking
pattern. These findings suggest early involvement by parents is needed to influence later
patterns of adolescent drinking.
Other longitudinal research (N = 537) found that adolescent initiation to alcohol was not
influenced by parenting behaviours or communication; however, alcohol-specific rules and
reprisals by parents predicted an escalation of alcohol use at a one-year follow-up, suggesting
a rebellion effect (Ennett et al., 2001). Conversely, Ryan et al. (2010) reviewed 77
longitudinal studies and reported limited evidence to support any relationship between
parental rules and adolescent drinking behaviours, but found that general communication
was associated with delayed initiation and lower levels of later drinking, and parental
disapproval of alcohol resulted in lower levels of later alcohol use.
Parent-child communication styles have also been found to be influential. For example,
Beck, Boyle and Boekeloo (2003) found that an adolescent’s willingness to talk to his/her
mother, and placing importance on one’s father’s opinion of alcohol, were both associated
with a reduced likelihood of adolescent drinking. Research also supports the association
between a lack of communication or parental concern and drinking behaviours. For example
a survey of English school students (N = 4,369) found that an indifferent parental attitude
was a significant factor in adolescent drinking, regardless of whether the parents were regular
drinkers or non-drinkers (Foxcroft & Lowe, 1997). The authors reported that additional
variables such as low parental control, low family support and regular parental drinking were
significant factors for higher drinking levels in adolescents.
48"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:53","Parent modelling of alcohol use
One of the key risk factors for adolescent alcohol use problems is the presence of alcohol
use problems in family members, especially parents. Studies have consistently found that
parents’ own use of alcohol increases the likelihood that their adolescent children will engage
in alcohol use (Chassin, Rogosch & Barrera, 1991; Ellis, Zucker & Fitzgerald, 1997). It is
likely that many inappropriate and harmful patterns of drinking are learned in the family.
Research has indicated that children of alcohol-dependent parents are at approximately four
times greater risk to use alcohol or develop alcohol-related problems than children of non-
alcohol-dependent parents (Chassin et al., 1999; Jacob et al., 1999; Weinberg, 1997). As
noted above, these children also tend to initiate alcohol use earlier and engage in problem
drinking at a younger age than non-exposed children (Bonomo et al., 2001). The importance
of parental modelling of alcohol use is highlighted when we consider the findings of Brown
and colleagues (1999). This study found that adolescents exposed to parental alcohol abuse
did not develop more negative attitudes towards alcohol use. Rather, these adolescents
tended to have positive attitudes to alcohol in general, and toward the positive effects of
alcohol in terms of dealing with stress and socialising (Brown et al., 1999).
Research has also demonstrated that less problematic, but frequent parental drinking is
associated with negative adolescent outcomes. For example, research on data from the
Australian Mater University cohort study (N = 2,551) found that maternal drinking (more
than one glass of alcohol a day) at the 14-year follow-up was a strong predictor of alcohol
use disorder in children at age 21 (Alati et al., 2005). Furthermore, Bonomo et al. (2001)
found that 16- to 17-year-old adolescents who reported that their parents drank daily were at
significantly greater risk of alcohol-related risk-taking. Alcohol-related problems in
succeeding generations of the one family are not uncommon, with younger family members
acquiring particular patterns of consumption from older family members. While a genetic
component may contribute to such problems, social learning is also likely to be an important
determining factor (Brown et al., 1999; White & Hayman, 2006; Essau & Hutchinson, 2008).
A qualitative study of Australian parental attitudes and adolescent drinking (N = 32)
indicates that many parents acknowledge the influence of their family backgrounds on their
own drinking behaviours, citing parents’ or grandparents’ alcoholism as having deterred
them from drinking (Gilligan & Kypri, 2012). Many of the parents in the study endorsed
communicating with their children about alcohol or using harm minimisation strategies, and
yet most parents discussed their own alcohol use as a personal preference rather than a
conscious plan to model behaviour to their child. Gilligan and Kypri (2012) conclude that
the influence of parental modelling of alcohol consumption is likely to be mediated by a
range of factors including parenting style and behaviour management, peer influence, and
expectations associated with alcohol consumption.
Alcohol initiation and parental supply of alcohol
The current legal age of purchase for alcohol in Australia is 18; however, most young
Australians have consumed alcohol before this age. The Australian School Students’ Alcohol
and Drug Survey (ASSAD) is a population-based survey measuring the alcohol consumption
patterns of Australian secondary students aged 12- to 17 years. The most recent survey in
2011 of 24,854 students shows that 74 per cent of Australian students have tried alcohol (at
49"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:54","least a sip) by the age of 14 years, and 90.9 per cent of Australian adolescents have tried
alcohol by the age of 17 years (White & Bariola, 2012).
Data from the 2010 NDSHS indicate that the average age when participants aged 14 to 24
years reported consuming their first full serve of alcohol was 14.8 years, and this average has
remained fairly stable since 2001 (AIHW, 2011a). Statistics on repeated consumption suggest
that once their first glass is consumed, a considerable number of adolescents progress to
regular drinking. For example, NDSHS data show that 5.3 per cent of males and 4.9 per cent
of females aged 12 to 17 were classified as regular weekly drinkers (an average of 5.1 per cent
of combined males and females) while 33 per cent of 12 to 17-year-olds drank less than
weekly and 59.3 per cent had never had a full serve of alcohol (AIHW, 2011a). Higher rates
were reported in the ASSAD survey, with 18.4 per cent of males and 16.4 per cent of
females aged 12 to 17 years reporting alcohol consumption in the past week (White &
Bariola, 2012). These considerable differences are most likely due to variations in survey
content and methodology, including differences between the two studies in the place of data
collection (e.g. at school versus at home) and the phrasing of the questions. The ASSAD
survey reveals that the proportion of current drinkers (consumed alcohol in the past seven
days) increases with age and peaks at age 17 for 39 per cent of males and 34.5 per cent of
females, as shown in Table 1. This prevalence of adolescent current drinking has been
shown to be decreasing over time in both the ASSAD and NDSHS datasets and their
respective previous surveys, with an increase in the number of young people reporting they
have never drunk a full serve of alcohol (AIHW, 2011a; White & Bariola, 2012; White &
Smith, 2010).

Parents are a major source of alcohol supply for many young Australians, and children are
often first introduced to alcohol in the family home (King, Taylor & Carroll, 2005).
According to ASSAD data, parents were reported to be the most common source for
obtaining alcohol by adolescents who were current (weekly) drinkers. As shown in Table 2,
32.9 per cent of both males and females indicated that their parents gave them their last
drink (White & Bariola, 2012). A small proportion (eight per cent) of respondents indicated
50"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:55","that they obtained their last drink from siblings, with 4.9 per cent of students taking alcohol
from home. Interestingly, the proportion of students indicating parents as their source of
alcohol was significantly greater among the younger students (34.9 per cent) than the older
students (31.3 per cent) who also commonly had friends or someone else buy for them, or
bought it themselves (White & Bariola, 2012). Given that parents are a major source of
alcohol supply for many young Australians, their influence during the early stages of
adolescence may be especially important.

Students were also asked to indicate where they consumed their last alcoholic drink. The
most common responses to this question are shown in Table 3, for males, females and all
students in each age group between 12 and 17 years old. The proportion of students
drinking at home decreased with age among both males and females; the most common
place for younger students to drink alcohol was in the family home (38.6 per cent) compared
to older students who were more likely to drink at a party (39.9 per cent). The majority of
current drinkers reported they consumed their last alcoholic drink under adult supervision
(64 per cent of both males and females, all ages). Among females, this adult supervision
decreased with age from 88.4 per cent of 12-year-olds to 64.6 per cent of 17-year-olds;
however, for males there was no significant change in adult supervision (White & Bariola,
2012). Both younger and older students drank less alcohol per week if they obtained their
alcohol from parents than if they obtained it by having someone else buy it for them.
Among younger students, weekly consumption of alcohol was also significantly lower if
obtained from parents as opposed to friends. Both younger and older students drank
significantly fewer alcoholic drinks per week if they drank at home than if they drank at a
friend’s house or at a party (White & Bariola, 2012).

Evidence suggests that introducing adolescents to alcohol at a young age can have negative
outcomes. There is increasing empirical evidence to suggest that the younger the age at
which a child or adolescent commences drinking, the greater the risk of alcohol-related
problems in later life. For example, longitudinal data from New Zealand show that the
commencement of alcohol use in early adolescence increases the likelihood of the later
development of high-risk use, independent of other influences (Fergusson, Lynskey &
Horwood, 1994). The 2007 NDSHS revealed that nine per cent of Australian students aged
14 to 19 years drank alcohol at least weekly at levels which put them at risk or high risk of
short- or long-term harm, based on the 2001 NHMRC alcohol guidelines (AIHW, 2008). A
Victorian sample of the 2008 ASSAD study revealed that 16-year-old current drinkers who
drank at levels for short-term risk of harm were significantly more likely to have had their
first full serve of alcohol at a younger age than non-risky drinkers (White & Smith, 2010). In
another study on early exposure to alcohol, children who had been introduced to alcohol
before the age of six were shown to be 1.9 to 2.4 times more likely to report frequent, heavy
or problem drinking at age 15 years than children who did not drink alcohol before the age
of 13 (Toumbourou et al., 2004). Longitudinal research in Australia has also shown that
regular drinking in adolescence is a risk factor for the development of risky patterns of use in
young adulthood (Grant & Dawson, 1997).
Other studies suggest that the longer adolescents delay having their first alcoholic drink, the
less likely they are to become regular or problem drinkers. For example, results from the
2005 ASSAD survey show that adolescents who start drinking later are more likely to report
that they are light or occasional drinkers, and they are less likely to binge drink (Premier’s
Drug Prevention Council, 2003). Data from the National Longitudinal Epidemiologic Survey
of 27,616 people in the US show that the lifetime alcohol dependence rates for individuals
who initiate alcohol use by age 14 are four times higher than those who start drinking at 20
years of age or older (Grant & Dawson, 1997). After adjusting for potentially confounding
variables, the odds of lifetime dependence decreased by 14 per cent with each additional year
52"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:57","of delayed initiation, and the odds of abuse decreased by eight per cent (Grant & Dawson,
1997).
Although it is difficult to prove a direct causal relationship, research suggests that lowering
the legal alcohol purchasing age in New Zealand in 1999 from 20 to 18 years old was
associated with increases in the number of alcohol-related hospital admissions and motor
vehicle accidents (Cagney & Palmer, 2007; Casswell & Maxwell, 2005; Everitt & Jones, 2002;
Kypri et al., 2006; Lash, 2005). There is also evidence to suggest that the younger the age at
which young people begin regular social drinking, the poorer the outcomes will be (Bonnie
& O’Connell, 2004). Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between underage
drinking (particularly binge drinking) and an increase in negative outcomes including
violence, motor vehicle accidents, memory loss, high-risk sexual behaviour, physical injury,
and suicide (Birckmayer, 1999; Adolescent Health Research Group, 2004; Hingson et al.,
2000; Palmer, Fryer & Kalafatelis, 2006). However, research shows that this relationship
disappears once other factors are taken into account such as whether the adolescent
becomes intoxicated at first use, family history of alcohol abuse and delinquency (Warner &
White, 2003). There is also evidence from Mediterranean countries where alcohol is
integrated into everyday life and served at the dinner table that young people become
intoxicated less frequently than in countries where alcohol is consumed less frequently but at
higher levels (e.g. Nordic countries) (Kuendig et al., 2008).
Evidence indicates that early onset drinking increases the risk for future drinking problems;
however, other factors may also play a role in this relationship. It may be the case, for
example, that adolescents who commence drinking at a young age and who subsequently go
on to misuse alcohol in late adolescence or adulthood have been exposed to other familial
and social risks that, together with early exposure to drinking, increase the risk for adverse
outcomes (Foxcroft & Lowe, 1991). In support of this notion, Fergusson et al. (1994)
identified consistent correlations between the age of reported first use of alcohol and
measures indicative of positive parental attitudes to alcohol use and approval of alcohol use
by young people. The authors suggested that early reported alcohol use was, to some extent,
an indicator measure of home environments in which alcohol was used frequently and
viewed positively (see above discussion on parental attitudes towards drinking).
Although the early onset of alcohol use places individuals at greater risk of alcohol-related
problems, this research suggests the risk is greatest among young people who live in home
environments that adopt generally permissive and encouraging attitudes to alcohol use in
their children (Foxcroft & Lowe, 1997; Williams & Hine, 2002). Further research is needed
to determine whether early initiation is itself a key risk factor, or whether the presence of
other factors (e.g. parental permissiveness regarding alcohol use, parent-child relationship
problems), in combination with early exposure, increase the risk for negative outcomes. A
third alternative that needs to be tested is whether early initiation is actually a proxy risk
factor, or marker for the presence of other risks that account for the increased likelihood of
developing alcohol use problems.

children
4.6.1 Prenatal exposure to alcohol, prevalence and impacts
In a survey of approximately 5,000 non-Indigenous Western Australian women between
1995 and 1997, 60 per cent reported drinking in pregnancy and four per cent reported
drinking at ‘binge’ levels (defined as five or more standard drinks per occasion during
pregnancy by Colvin et al., 2007). In comparison, a national survey of Indigenous women
revealed that approximately 80 per cent abstained from drinking during pregnancy which is
significantly higher than reported by pregnant non-Indigenous women (Australian Health
Ministers’ Advisory Council, 2011). These statistics fail to distinguish between the rates of
drinking and the quantity of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. O’Leary and colleagues
(2013) believe that maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy is significantly
underreported in Australia, and Indigenous women who drink during pregnancy are more
likely to do so at risky levels than non-Indigenous women. Walpole et al., (1991) suggest
these mothers may be less honest about self-reported alcohol use during pregnancy due to
fears of potential involvement of child services and loss of custody. Indigenous mothers may
have continued to drink heavily throughout pregnancy but were not identified or had limited
access to treatment services, especially in rural or remote areas.
In another study of women’s attitudes, women were found to be more likely to intend to
drink during pregnancy if they were unaware of the risk of harm associated with prenatal
alcohol consumption (Peadon et al., 2011). More recent statistics from the 2010 NDSHS
(AIHW, 2011a) show a significant increase of abstinence during pregnancy between 2007 (40
per cent) to 2010 (48.9 per cent), a finding which may be attributable to increased public
awareness, or to the 2009 changes in the Australian Alcohol guidelines which recommend
that women abstain from alcohol while pregnant or breastfeeding. However, this message
was only being taken up by roughly half of pregnant women surveyed in the 2010 NDSHS,
which reported 47.3 per cent of pregnant women consumed alcohol before knowing they
were pregnant and 19.5 per cent of women continued to drink even after pregnancy
awareness (Callinan & Room, 2012). Further, 65.6 per cent of women reported drinking
while breastfeeding, a finding which suggests that a sizable proportion of women resume
drinking immediately after giving birth (AIHW, 2011a). The alcohol guidelines were found to
be a significant predictor of drinking during pregnancy by an Australian prospective cohort
study (Anderson et al., 2013) using data from the ALSWH. This study found that of 1,969
women who were pregnant either in 2000, 2003, 2006 or 2009, the women were 60 per cent
more likely to drink when the guidelines condoned light drinking compared to when the
guidelines advised abstinence during pregnancy.
A review of 14 international cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examined common
predictors of maternal drinking during pregnancy. The review found that higher rates of pre-
pregnancy drinking (both in quantity and frequency of alcohol use), and also maternal
exposure to abuse or violence were important predictors. Factors less consistently associated
with drinking in pregnancy were higher maternal age, lower education, smoking, prior
pregnancies, being unmarried, higher income, and psychiatric symptoms (Skagerstrom,
Chang & Nilsen, 2011). Australian data corroborate these predictors, indicating that weekly
54"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:59","drinking and binge drinking prior to pregnancy were significant factors influencing the
likelihood of antenatal drinking, while fertility problems and low socio-economic status
reduced the likelihood of alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Anderson et al., 2013).
Among Indigenous communities, the loss of traditional culture has also been identified as an
important risk factor for fetal alcohol exposure (O’Leary, 2002).
In addition to the high risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), alcohol
consumption by women in early pregnancy, and by both men and women at the time of
conception, can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, still-birth, premature birth and
low birth weight (Breen & Burns, 2012; Henriksen et al., 2004; Kesmodel et al., 2002;
O’Leary et al., 2009). Children exposed to alcohol have an increased risk of prenatally
acquired cerebral palsy (CP) at a rate of 73 per 1,000 births, compared to a rate of CP of
between 2.4 to 4.7 per 1,000 births for children not exposed to alcohol (O’Leary et al., 2012).
A Western Australian study using data from 1983 to 2007 (N = 84,364) revealed that heavy
alcohol use by non-Indigenous mothers during pregnancy increased the risk of CP three-fold
(OR 3.32), while Indigenous children with CP were 2.5 times more likely to have a mother
diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder in the 12 months prior to pregnancy (O’Leary et al.,
2012).
Prevalence of FASD in Australia and internationally
Prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk for a range of physical, cognitive and mental
health problems in children (Clarke et al., 2004; Richter & Richter 2001). The full range of
possible outcomes resulting from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy are referred to as
FASD (Barr & Streissguth, 2001). The most severe outcome is known as Fetal Alcohol
Syndrome (FAS), and the less severe forms as partial FAS (Abel, 1998; Moore et al., 2002);
prenatal exposure to alcohol can also result in alcohol related birth defects and alcohol
related neurodevelopment disorders (Breen & Burns, 2012).
FAS is now regarded as the leading, preventable cause of non-genetic intellectual handicap in
the Western world (O’Leary, 2002). An ongoing system using the Australian Paediatric
Surveillance Unit (APSU) is one mechanism for case identification and reporting by child
health specialists to obtain national estimates of FAS in Australia (Bower et al., 2002; Burns
et al., 2013). The APSU study provided previously unavailable data on the epidemiology of
FAS in Australia, which was previously reported by passive surveillance systems within
various states and territories. The most recent release of data between 2001 and 2004 suggest
a national birth prevalence estimate of 0.06 per 1,000 live births, with an overrepresentation
of Indigenous children (Elliott et al., 2008).
Although there is limited national data, other Australian jurisdictions have estimated the
prevalence of FAS. In Western Australia (WA), the linking of the Birth Defects Registry and
the Rural Paediatric Service database resulted in a comprehensive estimate of the birth
prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome. The estimate from the 1980/97 data sets is 0.18 per
1,000 births for non-Indigenous children in WA, and 2.76/1,000 births for Indigenous
children in WA (Bower et al., 2000). The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome has also been
estimated in the Northern Territory for children born between 1990 and 2000. The estimate
is 0.68 per 1,000 live births for non-Indigenous children, and 1.87 per 1,000 live births for
55"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:60","Indigenous children (Harris & Bucens, 2003). Additionally, estimates collected from the
Victorian Perinatal Data Collection and the Victorian Birth Defects Register between 1995
and 2002, suggest the prevalence of FAS ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births (Allen
et al., 2007).
It is notable that outside Australia, similar patterns have been reported, with the incidence or
prevalence of FAS being highest for African American groups in the US, Indigenous groups
in the US and Canada, and for coloured/mixed races in South Africa (May et al., 2004;
O’Leary, 2002; Rutman & Bibber, 2010). It is believed that the increased incidences are not
independently related to race, but that poverty and its associated risks were factors
contributing to high rates of FAS in these Indigenous populations (Harris & Bucens, 2003).
The prevalence of FAS has also been shown to vary between communities of the same racial
group, suggesting that there may be high-risk sub-groups within some communities
(O’Leary, 2002). The increased awareness of the contribution of FASD to the burden of
disease amongst Australia’s Indigenous population has prompted significant attention and
Parliamentary Inquiry into the prevention, incidence and management of FASD, both from
government organisations and those working with Indigenous peoples within the community
(Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, 2010;
Australian Human Rights Commission, 2012; Fitzpatrick et al., 2012).
Presentation of FASD for children exposed to alcohol
The literature supports the biological role of alcohol as a teratogen, or substance that causes
birth defects. A number of mechanisms of the effects of alcohol as a teratogen have been
described, including hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), hormonal imbalances and the direct effects
of alcohol on cellular processes during the prenatal period (Abel, 1998; Gabriel et al., 1998;
Michaelis & Michaelis, 1994; Overholser, 1990). The expression of full FAS is found in
children whose mothers have a history of chronic heavy alcohol use or frequent heavy
intermittent alcohol use in pregnancy. The impact of heavy alcohol consumption has been
shown to vary depending on the timing of exposure on fetal development. The teratogenic
impact of alcohol on the fetus is varied by the timing, dosage, frequency and exposure
during gestation (Grant et al., 2013). The primary teratogenic effects occur during the first
eight weeks of gestation, while exposure to alcohol later in pregnancy can affect growth and
lead to behavioural and cognitive disorders (Abel, 1998; Gabriel et al., 1998; Michaelis &
Michaelis, 1994; O’Leary, 2002; Overholser, 1990; Streissguth et al., 1999). Research suggests
that binge drinking is particularly harmful because the fetus may be exposed to high blood
alcohol concentration and withdrawal episodes during critical periods of development (Maier
& West, 2001).
The diagnosis of FAS is based on a set of criteria comprised of abnormalities in three main
areas: characteristic physical abnormalities, growth retardation and central nervous system
abnormalities with intellectual impairment (Abel, 1998; Moore et al., 2002). FAS is also
associated with a complex pattern of cognitive and behavioural dysfunction. Secondary
symptoms can include poor impulse control and hyperactivity, deficits in attention, memory
or judgment, poor problem-solving and arithmetic skills, language problems (both in
understanding and speaking), and deficits in abstract thinking, perception and motor
development. These effects place children at greater risk of experiencing difficulties in
56"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:61","schooling, problems in relating to others and increased risk of involvement in criminal
justice and incarceration (Breen & Burns, 2012; Moore et al., 2002; O’Leary, 2004;
Streissguth et al., 2004). Less common presentations of FAS include skeletal malformations,
cardiac problems, visual and auditory deficits, and altered immunological function
(Chaudhuri, 2000; Johnson & Leff, 1999; Weinberg, 1997).
There is increasing evidence that alcohol consumption in pregnancy can also have
detrimental effects on children later in life. FAS has been associated with language and social
communication deficits in school-aged children (Coggins, Timler & Olswang, 2007), as well
as attention, memory and information processing deficits in adolescence (Streissguth et al.,
1999; Clark et al., 2004). Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also associated with antisocial and
delinquent behavioural problems in adolescence and young adulthood, which can include
poor impulse control, poor social adaptation, trouble with the law, inappropriate sexual
behaviour, difficulties with employment and substance use problems (Jacobson, 1999;
Jacobson & Jacobson, 2002; Rutman & Bibber, 2010; Streissguth et al., 1999). Research
suggests these individuals are particularly vulnerable and more likely to engage in risky
behaviours common in adolescence due to impaired decision-making and deficits in
executive functioning associated with FASD (Rasmussen & Wyper, 2007).
Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also strongly associated with the development of alcohol use
problems. In a study of adverse outcomes for those prenatally exposed to alcohol (N = 415)
substance use problems, predominantly alcohol use, were reported for 46 per cent of adults
and 35 per cent of children (Streissguth et al., 2004). Baer and colleagues (2003) conducted a
21-year longitudinal analysis of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on young adult
drinking. Prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with alcohol problems at 21
years of age, independent of the effects of family history of alcohol problems, nicotine
exposure, other prenatal exposures, and postnatal environmental factors including parental
use of other drugs. Grant et al. (2013) suggest that many adults with undiagnosed FASD
who enter treatment for alcohol use disorders fail to complete treatment due to
neurocognitive deficits which impair their ability to engage in the process.
Many children born with prenatal alcohol exposure also suffer mental health problems and
psychiatric disabilities throughout their lifetimes. A review of the existing literature, including
longitudinal studies, was conducted by O’Connor and Paley (2009) and summarised the
lifetime outcomes for children with prenatal exposure to alcohol (which includes FAS and
partial FAS diagnoses). They reported that exposure to alcohol was associated with insecure
attachment and depressive symptoms in infancy and early childhood. Middle childhood
showed associations with mood disorders (including anxiety, depression and mania);
attention problems, including ADHD; social problems and antisocial behaviour, delinquency
and conduct disorders. Adolescents and young adults experienced mood disorders (including
anxiety, depression and panic attacks), suicide behaviours, psychotic disorders, conduct
problems, aggression and antisocial personality disorder, and substance use disorders
(O’Connor & Paley, 2009). An Australian study conducted by Breen and Burns (2012) of 29
families caring for a child or adult affected by FASD revealed high rates of comorbidity, with
the majority reporting more than one diagnosis. ADHD or ADD was most common,
followed by learning disorder and intellectual disability (Breen & Burns, 2012). One study of
adults in the US who had been born with FAS or milder fetal alcohol effects (N = 25) found
that 72 per cent of the participants had received some form of psychiatric treatment, with 24
57"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:62","per cent requiring hospitalisation in a psychiatric institution (Famy, Streissguth & Unis,
1998). In a Canadian study of 62 persons of various ages with FAS or partial FAS diagnoses,
92 per cent of the participants had a history of mental health problems, with depression
being the most frequently reported problem among adults (47 per cent) (Clark et al., 2004).
Risk threshold for FASD
Establishing a threshold for risk of prenatal alcohol use has proved difficult and this
difficulty supports the emerging evidence that the risk may differ for different developmental
effects. Part of the difficulty in establishing a risk threshold is also the fact that there is a
range of other confounding factors likely to influence the severity of effects experienced by a
child prenatally exposed to alcohol (O’Leary, 2004; Single, Ashley & Bondy, 1999; Testa et
al., 2003). As noted above effects can vary depending on how much alcohol a child is
exposed to, the pattern of the mother’s drinking, the duration of exposure, and the stage of
pregnancy during which the drinking occurred. The mother’s age, culture, health, nutrition,
prenatal care, genetic predisposition, use of other drugs, the presence of maternal psychiatric
disorders, and socioeconomic status can also influence the extent of the problems resulting
from prenatal exposure to alcohol.
There is some evidence to suggest that low-to-moderate levels of alcohol consumption in
pregnancy can impact negatively on embryo and fetal development (Day et al., 2002; Day &
Richardson, 2004; Day et al., 1999; Jacobson & Jacobson, 2002; O’Leary et al., 2009),
although not all studies found an effect for low-to-moderate consumption (Alati et al., 2008;
Kelly et al., 2013; Kesmodel et al., 2012; Testa et al., 2003; Walpole et al., 1991). The most
likely effects at these levels are abnormalities in the developing embryo and subtle
neurobehavioural problems that are not associated with immediately recognisable physical
abnormalities. For example, some studies report a significant relationship between alcohol
and decreased psychomotor performance (Larroque et al., 1995), decreased verbal learning
and memory (Richardson et al., 2002) and decreased academic achievement (Goldschmidt et
al., 1996).
To clarify whether there is a clear threshold for risk, Testa et al. (2003) suggested that future
research would benefit from greater consideration of differences in the dosage and timing of
drinking, and the impact of maternal health and psychosocial factors on infant development.
A recent Danish birth cohort study of 1,628 families (Kesmodel et al., 2012) found no effect
for the groups categorised as low (one to four drinks per week), moderate (five to eight
drinks per week) or binge (five or more drinks on a single occasion) maternal drinking
during pregnancy on measures of the child’s intelligence, attention or executive functioning
at five years of age. There remained no significant differences even when the results were
adjusted for a range of potential covariates, including the child’s gender, parental education
and maternal smoking (Kesmodel et al., 2012). The Millennium Cohort Study (Kelly et al.,
2013), a prospective cohort study of 10,534 families in the UK, found no effect of low
exposure to alcohol during pregnancy (up to two units of alcohol per week) on behavioural
or cognitive difficulties in children when followed up at age seven, when compared with
mothers who abstained during pregnancy. Similarly, Alati et al. (2008) found no strong
association between alcohol consumption in the first three months of pregnancy and
58"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:63","variation in childhood mean IQ scores at age eight in the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (N = 4,332).
Further , another UK ALSPAC study followed up 6,915 children at age 10 and found no
effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on childhood balance ability, a
measure of neurodevelopmental outcomes underpinning motor development (Humphriss et
al., 2013). These findings were across groups including low (one or two drinks per week) to
moderate alcohol use (three to seven drinks per week), high alcohol use (greater than seven
drinks per week) and binge drinking (greater than four units per day), and these results were
similar for both paternal and postnatal maternal use. An apparent beneficial effect of higher
maternal and paternal alcohol consumption on child balance was attributed to confounding
due to higher social advantage associated with moderate alcohol use compared with
abstinence or binge drinking. These results provide some support that low levels of alcohol
exposure during pregnancy may not be harmful to a child’s development.
In summary, alcohol consumption at high levels during pregnancy can lead to a range of
adverse outcomes for the fetus including FASD. The question of whether there is a safe
level of drinking during pregnancy remains to be established. While there is some evidence
that low-to-moderate alcohol intake during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with
an increased risk of fetal malformations or physical, behavioural or cognitive consequences,
there appears to be some evidence for a dose-response association. A threshold level below
which consumption is not teratogenic has not been formally established (NIAAA, 2003), and
for these reasons the Australian Alcohol Guidelines changed in 2009 to an abstinence-based
approach, recommending that for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning a
pregnancy not drinking is the safest option to avoid adverse effects (NHMRC, 2009).
4.6.2 Disturbances in childhood, adolescence and adulthood
Not only can parental drinking have long-term effects prenatally, but alcohol use also has a
significant impact on postnatal mortality and morbidity. A large body of empirical evidence
shows that children of alcohol abusing parents are at elevated risk for a range of maladaptive
outcomes in childhood, adolescence and into adulthood (Chassin et al., 1999; Harter &
Taylor, 2000; Johnson & Leff, 1999; Lynskey et al., 1994; Sher et al., 1991; West & Prinz,
1987). The following two sections will review literature on the relationship between parental
alcohol use disorders and disturbances in: (a) physical health, (b) psychological and
emotional development and behaviour, and (c) cognitive development. The final section will
overview research on the increased risk for alcohol abuse and dependence in children
exposed to parental drinking problems.
An important issue to consider is that many of the studies assessing current or retrospective
parent alcohol use do not report controlling for prenatal alcohol exposure and because the
effects on psychological, behavioural, emotional and cognitive development share many
features observed as a result of prenatal exposure, these findings may be better explained by
maternal alcohol use during pregnancy rather than parental alcohol use during childhood.
Where possible, research where paternal abuse alcohol has been studied and those which
have controlled for prenatal exposure have been included in the discussion in relation to
children’s psychological, emotional, behavioural and cognitive development.
59"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:64","Physical health disturbances
There has been limited research on the physical effects of postnatal exposure to alcohol for
children, as these effects are less direct compared to prenatal exposure and more difficult to
quantify. Estimates indicate that for Australian children aged 0 to 14 years old in 2005,
approximately 17 per cent of deaths and 13 per cent of hospitalisations were attributable to
the drinking of others, predominantly caused by child abuse and road crashes (Laslett et al.,
2010). US epidemiological data of 65,926 child and parent pairs indicate that even when
confounding variables are controlled for, children of problem drinking parents have an
increased likelihood of accessing health care in the past year, both in frequency of visits to a
paediatrician and to hospital emergency wards (Balsa & French, 2012). Earlier US data
indicate that high rates of hospitalisations for children of alcohol-dependent parents were
commonly resulting from injury, poisonings, mental health concerns and substance
intoxication (Children of Alcoholics Foundation, 1990). This is likely due to insufficient
monitoring and impaired judgement by alcohol-affected parents.
Psychological, emotional and behavioural disturbances
Research has demonstrated a consistent relationship between parental alcohol use disorders
and psychological, emotional and behavioural problems in offspring (Harter, 2000; Russell,
Henderson & Bloom, 1984; Sher, 1997; West & Prinz, 1987). Children of alcohol abusing
parents generally report two main types of problems: outwardly directed externalising
problems, including symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder
and antisocial personality disorder; or, inwardly directed internalising problems, including
symptoms of anxiety and depression.
The majority of research in this area has involved retrospective comparison of a range of
mental health and personality characteristics among adults with and without histories of
childhood exposure to parental drinking. Although not all studies have produced consistent
findings, the majority of retrospective studies indicate that children raised in families where
one or both parents abuse alcohol are at increased risk for a range of negative outcomes.
Outcomes for which there is considerable empirical evidence include: impulsive and
antisocial personality traits, including elevated levels of risk-taking, sensation seeking, and
aggressive and antisocial behaviours, low self-esteem (Beaudoin et al., 1997; Domenico &
Windle, 1993; Hill et al., 1999; Sher et al., 1991), anxiety, depressive and substance abuse
disorders, difficulties in family relationships and generalised distress and maladjustment
(Sher, 1991; Harter, 2000).
Numerous cross-sectional studies have also examined the characteristics of children and
adolescents with one or more alcohol abusing parent. Consistent with research on adult
samples, these studies have generally found that the children of alcohol abusing parents are
at elevated risk for a range of psychological, emotional and behavioural problems.
Specifically, research shows that these children frequently demonstrate elevated levels of
hyperactivity and restlessness, attentional difficulties, impulsivity, oppositionality, antisocial
behaviour, poor academic performance, social problems, depressive affect and anxiety
symptoms, as well as drug and alcohol use (see Andreas & O’Farrell, 2007; Chassin et al.,
60"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:65","1993; Chassin et al., 1991; Diaz et al., 2008; Furtado, Laucht & Schmidt, 2006; Peiponen et
al., 2006; Sher, 1997; Spijkerman, van den Eijnden & Huiberts, 2008; West & Prinz, 1987).
Lynskey and colleagues (1994) used data from the Christchurch longitudinal study (N = 961)
in New Zealand to examine the relationship between parental alcohol use disorders and
young people’s mental health outcomes. The study found that young people raised in
families in which a parent was dependent on alcohol had rates of psychiatric disorders at the
age of 15 that were between 2.2 and 3.9 times higher than young people raised in families in
which there were no reported parental alcohol problems. These associations were reflected
in increased risks of both externalising disorders, including substance abuse and dependence,
conduct, oppositional and attention hyperactivity disorders, and internalising disorders,
including both mood and anxiety disorders. These relationships reduced to being between
1.6 and three times more likely to experience psychiatric problems, but remained robust,
after adjusting for a range of confounding factors, including maternal substance use during
pregnancy.
Lynskey et al. (1994) also found evidence of a consistent relationship between the extent of
reported alcohol problems in parents and adolescent outcomes. In general, teenagers whose
parents reported alcohol dependence had the worst prognosis followed by those whose
parents reported alcohol problems but not dependence, with teenagers whose parents did
not report alcohol problems having the best prognosis. Of the young people whose parents
were described as alcohol dependent, more than 50 per cent met diagnostic criteria for at
least one psychiatric disorder at the age of 15 years. These results suggest the presence of a
linear relationship between the extent to which parents exhibit alcohol-related problems and
an individual’s level of vulnerability to mental health problems in adolescence.
It has been suggested that the link between parental alcohol use disorders and child health
outcomes could be due to the fact that parental drinking interferes with healthy parenting,
(Richter & Richter, 2001). A longitudinal study of 235 families by Keller and colleagues
(2008) explored the directional effects between parental drinking and child adjustment
problems. The US study found that paternal drinking problems were related to increased
marital conflict. In turn, martial conflict was associated with decreased parental warmth, and
decreased warmth was related to young children’s internalising and externalising problems.
When controlling for paternal drinking there were no significant relations between maternal
drinking and marital conflict, parenting or child adjustment; however, maternal drinking was
highly correlated with paternal drinking and might be a weaker predictor of parental
relationship problems (Keller et al., 2008). These indirect pathways demonstrate the complex
family processes that increase the risk for disruptive child outcomes.
Taken together, evidence indicates that the offspring of parents with alcohol use disorders
experience higher levels of psychological, emotional and behavioural disturbances compared
to children of parents with no alcohol problems. Longitudinal cohort studies provide
evidence that child psychopathology can be predicted from parental alcohol abuse, and that
the frequency of these disturbances in children with two alcohol abusing parents is distinctly
higher than those with one alcohol abusing parent (Lynskey et al., 1994). However, there is
little empirical support for the notion of a ‘syndrome’ uniformly characterising children of
alcohol-abusing parents or distinguishing them from other high-risk groups (e.g. Brown,
1998). Rather, the literature suggests that there is considerable variation in outcomes, and
61"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:66","that these outcomes are not specific to children from families affected by alcohol. Evidence
suggests that this variability in individual outcomes is likely to be influenced by the severity
of parental drinking, as well as the presence of other childhood stressors, including
comorbid parental pathology, childhood abuse and family dysfunction.
Cognitive disturbances
The literature examining cognitive deficits in children with alcohol-dependent parents is
inconsistent (Poon et al., 2000). While a number of studies have documented deficits in
intellectual or academic performance and/or cognitive functioning (Casa-Gil & Navarro-
Guzman, 2002; Diaz et al., 2008; Finn & Hall, 2004; Schroeder & Kelley, 2008), others have
not (Leonard & Eiden, 2002). A multisite Spanish study conducted in eight cities with 371
children aged six to 17 of alcohol-dependent parents and 147 controls used a number of
cognitive tests and measures of academic performance to examine the impact of parental
alcohol misuse (Diaz et al., 2008). The results showed that the risk of poor school
achievement was nine times higher among children with an alcohol-dependent parent,
compared to controls. Additionally, the results of all cognitive tests used (including measures
of verbal abstraction, visuospatial abstraction, attention and cognitive flexibility) were worse
for these children (Diaz et al., 2008). This study also found that among exposed children,
having a larger number of relatives with a history of alcohol misuse was significantly related
to poor academic and cognitive performance (Diaz et al., 2008). The study excluded mothers
who drank more than five units of alcohol per week during pregnancy to control for prenatal
exposure; however, the authors acknowledged the inclusion of low-level prenatal alcohol use
was a limitation of the study.
Another cross-sectional survey of 226 children aged seven to 16 years identified five areas of
academic performance that were poorer among children with alcohol misusing parents:
intelligence, repeating a grade, low academic performance, school truancy, and dropping out
of school (Casa-Gil & Navarro-Guzman, 2002). Finn and Hall (2004) also assessed cognitive
ability among adult children of alcohol-dependent fathers (N = 303, mean age of 22.5 years
with no history of maternal drinking prior to or during pregnancy) and found that compared
to controls, they demonstrated lower IQs, lower verbal ability and more response
perseveration (i.e. continuing to respond to a particular stimulus, despite negative feedback)
(Finn & Hall, 2004).
Leonard and Eiden (2002) examined the cognitive functioning of 226 infants (tested at 12,
18 and 24 months old) from three family groups: 102 families in which the father was
alcohol-dependent; 20 families in which the father was alcohol dependent and the mother
was a heavy drinker; and 104 control families (matched on maternal education,
race/ethnicity, child gender, marital status and number of children). Infants with maternal
alcohol use during pregnancy were excluded from the study. The results revealed no
differences in cognitive functioning among the groups, suggesting no effect of paternal
alcohol misuse on overall cognitive development early in life (Leonard & Eiden, 2002). The
authors suggest that given these results, deficits in later cognitive functioning may be a result
of parenting and/or behavioural problems among children with alcohol-dependent parents
(Leonard & Eiden, 2002). It is also possible, however, that these effects are not apparent
until children are older. Additionally, another study identified adolescent task orientation as a
partial mediator between parental alcohol dependence and academic achievement, suggesting
62"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:67","impaired motivation and/or organisation may contribute to the poor academic performance
cited in other studies (McGrath, Watson & Chassin, 1999).
A more recent study examined executive functioning and behaviours associated with higher
order cognitive processes (which included flexibility in problem-solving and ability to control
emotions) among 315 college students with and without a history of parental alcohol abuse
(Schroeder & Kelley, 2008). The results showed that compared with controls, individuals
with a history of parental alcohol abuse had more deficits in executive functioning; however,
family environmental factors (including organisation, control, and communication) appeared
to be more important in influencing executive functioning (Schroeder & Kelley, 2008).
Alcohol use problems
Children of alcohol abusing parents are at elevated risk for alcohol use problems in
adolescence and adulthood (see Hayes et al., 2004). While not all children exposed to
parental alcohol abuse will go on to develop problems, research on clinical and treatment
samples suggests their risk is approximately four times higher than children not exposed to
parental alcohol abuse (Chassin et al., 1999; Jacob et al., 1999). It is likely that both biological
and environmental risk factors play a role in the development of alcohol use disorders
among children with alcohol-dependent parents (Hayes et al., 2004).
Although research has demonstrated that biological links (through twin and adoption
studies) exist in the relationship between parental alcohol dependence and alcohol misuse
among their children, these associations do not appear to be pervasive enough to draw firm
conclusions (Hawkins, Catalano & Miller, 1992; Hayes et al., 2004). For example, in their
review, Hawkins et al. (1992) highlight that approximately half the adults hospitalised for
alcohol dependence do not report a family history of alcohol abuse, suggesting that
biological linkages do not account for a significant proportion of cases. Historically, being
able to document exactly what leads to the development of alcohol misuse among
adolescents exposed to parental alcohol abuse has been a challenge for many studies due to
the number of confounding genetic and environmental risk factors. A twin study by Slutske
and colleagues (2008) of 2,334 offspring of 836 twin pairs (and 983 spouses of the twins)
suggested that after taking into account the confounding factors only a modest causal effect
is demonstrated for exposure to parental alcohol use disorders on offspring alcohol use
disorders. Taken together, twin studies have demonstrated that genetic factors account for
approximately 40 to 60 per cent of the variance in the development of alcohol dependence,
suggesting a substantial amount of variance may be attributable to non-genetic risk factors,
including parenting behaviours and disrupted parent-adolescent relationships (Duncan et al.,
2006).
As highlighted earlier, research suggests offspring with a family history of alcohol
dependence are at an increased risk of also developing an alcohol use disorder; however, this
conclusion has been based on research conducted mainly among clinical samples. Evidence
from community based samples also validates the findings from such clinical studies. Lieb
and colleagues (2002) examined the effect of exposure to parental alcohol use disorders on a
community based sample of German adolescents (N = 2,427) using a number of different
drinking outcomes and levels of use (including occasional use, regular use, hazardous use,
abuse and dependence). The results found that not only did parental alcohol abuse predict
63"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:68","the development of alcohol use disorders among the adolescent offspring but it also
predicted escalation of alcohol use (i.e. progressed more quickly into higher use categories),
and an earlier onset of a number of alcohol outcomes (i.e. first onset of hazardous use and
dependence).
Comparatively few longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between early
exposure to parental drinking and later outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. One
longitudinal study by Chassin and colleagues (1999) examined the effects of parental alcohol
misuse on adolescent psychological symptoms and substance use among 454 families. The
results demonstrated that parental alcohol misuse increased the subsequent risk for
substance misuse among adolescents, after adjustment for parental psychological disorder.
Hussong, Bauer & Chassin (2008) examined drinking trajectories from initiation to disorder
in 454 adolescents. Telescoped trajectories were identified among children of alcohol
misusing parents; they progressed more rapidly from alcohol use initiation to disorder, when
compared to matched controls. Notably, stronger effects were observed among those
children whose parents suffered from comorbid alcohol dependence and depression or
antisocial personality disorder (Hussong et al., 2008).
Peer associations and adolescent attitudes towards drinking have also been found to interact
with family influences in the development of adolescent alcohol use (Barnes & Farrell, 1992;
Brown et al., 1999). Barnes and Farrell (1992) used longitudinal modelling techniques to
demonstrate that adolescents were more likely to develop regular drinking patterns if they
were exposed to alcohol abuse in their family and had high peer orientation (i.e. peer opinion
was valued more than parents’ opinion in determining adolescent behaviour). These results
reveal that peer orientation is a significant predictor of drinking behaviour, and interacts with
measures of parenting.
Using longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, Fergusson
and colleagues (1995) examined the prospective relationship between parental alcohol use at
child age 11 years and abusive or hazardous drinking at 16 years of age. Results indicated
that parental alcohol use at child age 11 years did not directly predict abusive or hazardous
drinking at 16 years. Rather, the effect of parental alcohol use on the risk of later abusive or
hazardous drinking was mediated by adolescent peer affiliations at age 15 years. This finding
suggests that children of parents who use alcohol are more likely to have affiliations with
peers who also use alcohol or other substances. In turn, deviant peer affiliations appear to
increase the risk for alcohol abuse at age 16 years (Jacob & Leonard 1994; Wood, Vinson &
Sher, 2001). The results of this study suggest that the pathways of influence are likely to
involve complex links between multiple risks across time. These conclusions are supported
by the results of another longitudinal study which assessed the role of parental alcohol
misuse and parenting on adolescent alcohol use over three annual waves (N = 428 families)
(van der Zwaluw et al., 2008). Both parenting and exposure to parental alcohol misuse were
found to shape alcohol use among adolescents, highlighting the contribution of shared
environmental factors. This study also suggested that the contribution of certain factors may
change as adolescents get older, for example, the importance of parental versus peer drinking
may shift as adolescents get older and move beyond the initiation phase (van der Zwaluw et
al., 2008).
64"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:69","4.7 Protective factors
Of those who are exposed to risky parental drinking, not all children go on to suffer
psychological disorders. Compared to the large body of research on the risks of exposure to
parental drinking, comparatively few studies have examined protective factors that mitigate
against these risks. Some studies show that children of alcohol abusing parents may exhibit
undisturbed psychological functioning over time despite having a problem drinking parent
(Harter, 2000; Segrin & Menees, 1996). There appear to be a number of factors that enable
children to weather the problems of their childhood.
Children least at risk appear to be from families with high levels of family support, emotional
closeness, family management, control and cohesion, an intact family structure, families
where there is a non-drinking parent who can mitigate the effects of the problem drinker,
and those with fewer socio-economic problems (Chassin et al., 2004; Habib et al., 2010).
Social supports outside the family, such as support from school, friends and the community,
are also associated with better outcomes for children (e.g. Edwards, Eiden & Leonard, 2006;
Habib et al., 2010; Hill et al., 1997; Jacob & Leonard, 1994; Johnson & Leff, 1999; Sher,
1991).
Individual factors
Gender effects are apparent with the influence of family factors to protect adolescents from
risky alcohol use. A longitudinal study of 855 Australian students aged 10 and over by Kelly,
O’Flaherty et al. (2011) as part of the International Youth Development Survey explored the
influence of parental disapproval of drinking, family structure, family conflict, adolescent
sensation seeking, and peer alcohol use. The study found longitudinal lag effects for teenage
alcohol use that differed by gender. For girls, emotionally close relationships with mothers
was associated with less frequent alcohol use and reduced exposure to high-risk peer
networks, while parental disapproval decreased alcohol use for boys but not for girls (Kelly
et al., 2011a). A similar study of 6,837 students aged 11 and 13 by Kelly et al. (2011b) found
that emotional closeness to the parent of the opposite gender predicted lifetime alcohol use
for both boys and girls in Grade 6 but not for those in Grade 8. This study also found family
conflict significantly predicted alcohol use for preteen and early teenage girls but not for
boys, with the authors suggesting a reciprocal relationship between family conflict and
female alcohol use.
Resiliency has been postulated to be an important protective factor. Resiliency is acquired
through the development of coping resources which can be made up of behaviours
comprising cognitive, social, emotional and/or physical domains (Hall, 1997). Studies have
identified a number of behavioural characteristics among children of alcohol-dependent
parents that were protective against developing coping problems, including good
communication skills and level of knowledge; an internal locus of control; high levels of self-
esteem and an ability to express feelings (Werner, 1986; Walker & Lee, 1998; Moe, Johnson
& Wade, 2007). Additionally, Coyle et al. (2009) reported some families demonstrate
resilience in overcoming the risks associated with parental alcohol use. Characteristics of
resilient families are positive beliefs and values, role adaptability, closeness or cohesion,
65"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:70","effective communication, problem-solving and positive parenting skills which allow families
to collectively adapt to stressors and reduce negative outcomes relating to alcohol problems.
Self regulation or self-control is required for at-risk adolescents to make the choice to reduce
drinking to safe levels or abstain from alcohol, and a number of studies have explored this
trait as a protective factor for alcohol problems (Quinn & Fromme, 2010; Pearson, D’Lima
& Kelley, 2011). A study of 195 undergraduate college students found that higher self-
regulation did not reduce consumption of alcohol, but did reduce alcohol related-problems.
Those who were identified as an adult child of parents with an alcohol use disorder showed
increased consumption of alcohol and experienced more alcohol-related problems; however,
for this at-risk group, low, average or high self regulation was strongly related to the
experience of alcohol-related problems (Pearson et al., 2011). This study provides support
for the role of self regulation as a buffer against the risks of negative consequences for
children of parents with problematic alcohol use; however, previous longitudinal research
has shown that parental drinking interferes with the parenting processes which aid in the
development of self regulation (Eiden et al., 2009) thus increasing the risks for these
children.
Parenting factors
Becoming a parent is itself a protective effect for those with young children, reducing the
risk of alcohol misuse and therefore reducing the negative impacts on the children. A
recently published 30-year longitudinal birth cohort study in New Zealand (N = 347)
suggests a relationship between the transition to parenthood and the reduction in rates of
parental alcohol abuse and dependence, with females showing the most significant
reductions (Fergusson, Boden & Horwood, 2012). This study hypothesises there is a
protective effect for parents of dependent children, which persists when controlling for
possible confounding variables, such as socio-economic status, parental adjustment,
individual characteristics and childhood abuse of the parents.
Drinking patterns of parents are also important in determining outcomes. For example, there
is evidence that an unpredictable pattern of parental alcohol abuse may result in greater
disruption in family life than a more predictable, regular drinking pattern. Similarly, out-of-
home drinking patterns may to some extent insulate family and children from disruptions
that occur when drinking takes place at home (Jacob & Leonard, 1988; Jacob & Leonard,
1994). As discussed in previous sections, parental attitudes can also offer a protective effect
for children and adolescents. A prospective study of 256 college students over 22 months
reported that low parental permissiveness reduced the influence of social modelling from
peers and decreased heavy episodic drinking (Fairlie, Wood & Laird, 2012); however, this
study found no effect for parental monitoring, unlike earlier research cited.
Additionally, longitudinal research provides evidence for an ‘aversive transmission’ of
alcohol use, whereby perceived parental alcohol dependence and perceived risk of alcohol
dependence interact to reduce drinking behaviours in children of problematic drinkers
(Haller & Chassin, 2010). This study of 804 adolescents and young adult children of 401
parents with DSM-III diagnosed alcohol use disorders, supported prior research that these
children are at greater risk for alcohol use problems. However, greater perceived risk by the
66"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:71","children resulted in lower drinking levels thus demonstrating that alcohol expectancies
determine behaviours and can be modifiable (Haller & Chassin, 2010). This finding was
echoed by an Australian qualitative study, where parents reported that their own parents’ or
grandparents’ alcohol use influenced their choice to become non-drinkers or light drinkers,
and also reported that excessive drinking by spouses had polarised responses in their
children, with some being deterred from drinking and others becoming heavy drinkers
(Gilligan & Kypri, 2012). Thus the influence of parental drinking is likely mediated by
additional variables either creating a protective effect or increasing the risk for negative
outcomes.
While some children exposed to parental drinking do not experience adverse effects, there is
an overwhelming body of research to show that parental drinking has negative impacts for
drinking behaviour in offspring. Greater understanding of the factors that buffer children
against the adverse impacts associated with parental alcohol problems is needed.
67"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:72","CHAPTER 5. SYNTHESIS AND OVERVIEW OF THE
FINDINGS
This review has demonstrated that there is a large body of research showing significant
associations between parental alcohol use disorders and a range of problems in family life
and functioning. These problems include, but are not exclusive to, parent and family conflict
and violence, parental separation and divorce, parent mental health and other substance use
problems, economic problems, disrupted parenting, parent-child relationship problems, and
a range of mental health and cognitive disturbances and substance use in offspring. This
review has shown that these problems often co-occur in families affected by parental
drinking problems, particularly in families where both parents abuse or depend on alcohol.
As many studies in the literature reviewed have been cross-sectional, problems in family life
cannot be attributed solely to alcohol use. Rather, it is likely that these factors interact in
complex and dynamic ways, as well as with other macro- and local environmental factors, to
determine the specific impacts for each family.
Evidence that parental alcohol use disorders lead to family functioning problems is stronger
for some factors included in this review than for others. Table 4 summarises the empirical
evidence for the relationship between parental alcohol use problems and the key family-
related outcomes reviewed in this report. Table 4 highlights that most of these factors are
known correlates of alcohol use disorders in parents and adults. Despite the paucity of
longitudinal research on some of these factors, there is evidence to suggest that drinking
problems prospectively predict a number of negative outcomes (e.g. male-perpetrated
intimate partner violence, FASD from drinking in pregnancy). There is also evidence that
reciprocal, or bi-directional relations exist between alcohol problems and some variables (e.g.
male-perpetrated intimate partner violence, separation and divorce, comorbid mental health
and substance use issues, and financial problems and employment). Other findings that
emerged less frequently are described in the text, rather than displayed in Table 4. The final
column in the table indicates whether longitudinal research has been conducted in Australian
participants, and reveals that there has been limited prospective research on this issue in
Australia. Finally, it should be noted that Table 4 does not provide information on the
robustness of the findings; rather it provides a general overview of results. Readers are
referred to the relevant section in the review for more detailed information.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:74","While considerable progress has been made in understanding the relationship between
parental alcohol use disorders and the impacts on family life and children, there is a need to
draw together theoretical and empirical knowledge of these effects into a multivariate model
of influence. A conceptual model has therefore been proposed to summarise the research
that has been reviewed, and to provide an overall picture of the links identified between
parental alcohol abuse and dependence and family life (see Figure 3). This model is derived
from Jacob and Leonard’s model (1994) (see Chapter 3) and has been adapted to incorporate
the empirical findings presented in this review. The model depicts the risks associated with
parental alcohol use problems and their adverse impacts on family functioning and children.
It is important to note that this model is conceptual. Where evidence is available, the likely
direction of influence has been depicted. However, due to the paucity of longitudinal and
controlled intervention studies, the relationships in the model do not represent causal or
statistical relationships. Future research will need to determine the precise nature of the
relationships between these variables.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:76","Marital and intimate partner relationship quality
Relationships where one or both partners drink heavily are characterised by poor
relationship functioning, including marital dissatisfaction, elevated levels of conflict and
physical violence, and an increased risk for relationship breakdown, separation and
divorce. Longitudinal studies indicate that alcohol dependence predicts marital
dissatisfaction and divorce across time. Some people also appear to use alcohol as a
short-term means of coping with relationship breakdown, but there is insufficient
evidence to show that separation and divorce increase the risk for alcohol abuse or
dependence.
The relationship of alcohol use with male perpetrated physical violence appears to be
reciprocal, with excessive alcohol consumption in men increasing the risk of male-to-
female violence, and violent behaviour reciprocally increasing the risk of problematic
drinking. The effects of alcohol use disorders in women are less well studied than in men.
Women who abuse alcohol may be at greater risk of victimisation by their male partner.
Females who abuse alcohol are also at increased risk for perpetration of female-to-male
violence; however, these findings are inconsistent.
In the proposed model, parental relationship quality is connected with alcohol use
problems via a bi-directional arrow. This bi-directional arrow represents both the cross-
sectional associations and the prospective links that have been identified between alcohol
use disorders and parental relationship problems. As described in the present report,
families in which parents abuse alcohol are often characterised by a cluster of other
psychosocial and mental health problems. For this reason, pathways have been drawn
between parent relationship problems and both comorbid psychopathology and other
psychosocial risk factors. A pathway was also included from parental relationship
problems to problems in family functioning, as this link is widely acknowledged in the
literature.
Family functioning
Families with an alcohol-dependent or abusing parent frequently report problems in
family functioning. These problems can include communication difficulties, poor family
cohesion, and elevated levels of conflict and violence. Data on Indigenous people show
that family violence is highly prevalent in some communities and is frequently associated
with alcohol consumption.
Parental alcohol use disorders are commonly associated with disruptions in family
organisation and routines, and with economic problems that are related to money spent
on alcohol, difficulties sustaining job performance or loss of employment, and medical
costs due to alcohol-related health problems or accidents. These problems are also
related to lower rates of involvement and success among parents and families in
treatment.
In the conceptual model, a direct pathway was included from parental alcohol use
disorders to family functioning disruptions. Bi-directional pathways were also included
between family functioning and both parent-child relationship quality and parenting
disruptions.
72"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:77","Co-occurring mental health and other substance use disorders in parents
Alcohol use disorders frequently co-occur with other substance use disorders and with
psychological illnesses, including depression, anxiety, psychosis and personality disorders.
While the specific pathways via which alcohol and other mental health problems impact
on family life are unclear, families where one or both parents suffer comorbid mental
health and alcohol use disorders are at high-risk for a range of negative outcomes. These
effects appear likely to vary as a function of the type and severity of comorbid disorders
experienced by a parent. Based on the evidence reviewed, it is reasonable to conclude
that the harms discussed in this review, such as family conflict and violence, economic
difficulties, parenting disruptions, and mental health problems in children, occur more
frequently and are more severe in families where comorbid alcohol and other mental
health problems are present. In the conceptual model, parental psychopathology is bi-
directionally linked to parental drinking problems. A pathway was also included from
parent psychopathology to family problems, as this link is widely acknowledged in the
literature.
Parenting
Parenting is disrupted in families where one or both parents are problem drinkers.
Parental alcohol use problems are associated with inconsistent parenting, infant
attachment problems, lack of parental sensitivity and nurturance, and inadequate child
monitoring and socialisation. There is also evidence that parents who abuse alcohol
sometimes abdicate their parenting roles, leaving children to take on roles and
responsibilities that are inappropriate for their age.
Parental alcohol use disorders are associated with a small to moderate increase in risk for
child abuse. It is notable that Indigenous children are significantly over-represented in
most child protection reports of abuse or neglect. The extent and pervasiveness of
parental alcohol exposure, and the presence of a range of other risks, both appear to
increase the risk for child abuse. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that
alcohol problems directly lead to child abuse.
Based on the literature reviewed, there appear to be a number of pathways of influence
via which parental alcohol use problems might lead to ineffective parenting. For example,
elevated levels of paternal drinking have been shown to directly predict negative parent-
infant interactions in both fathers and mothers. The presence of parental
psychopathology and marital conflict have also been shown to mediate this relationship,
indirectly increasing the risk for negative parent-child interactions. Additionally, poor
parental monitoring and socialisation appears to be characteristic of families with
parental alcohol misuse and has been shown to lead to problems through the
development of negative parenting practices.
Although prospective research is needed to disentangle the pathways of influence,
current research supports the notion that alcohol interferes with a parent’s ability to
parent effectively (Jacob & Leonard, 1994). In the conceptual model, parenting
disruptions have been conceptualised to be bi-directionally related to the quality of the
parent-child relationship. Through these pathways, parental drinking problems are
depicted as influencing negative outcomes in offspring, including alcohol use behaviour.
73"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:78","Physical, cognitive and mental health outcomes in offspring
Alcohol consumption at high levels during pregnancy, particularly chronic heavy alcohol
use or frequent heavy intermittent alcohol use, leads to a range of adverse outcomes in
children, including FASD. The question of whether there is a safe level of drinking
during pregnancy remains to be established. While low-to-moderate alcohol intake during
pregnancy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations,
it may have detrimental behavioural or cognitive consequences.
Children of alcohol abusing parents are at elevated risk for a range of maladaptive
outcomes in childhood, adolescence and into adulthood, including increased health
service utilisation, disturbances in psychological and emotional development, behavioural
disorders, cognitive deficits and alcohol use problems. Longitudinal cohort studies
provide evidence that child psychopathology can be predicted from parental alcohol use.
The literature suggests that there is considerable variation in outcomes, and that this
variability in individual outcomes is likely to be influenced by the severity of parental
drinking, as well as the presence of other childhood stressors, including comorbid
parental pathology, childhood abuse and family dysfunction.
Parents’ own use of alcohol significantly increases the likelihood that their adolescent
children will engage in alcohol use. Possible mechanisms of influence on adolescent
drinking may include parental modelling of alcohol use, a biological susceptibility to
alcohol use problems, family norms and parental attitudes regarding drinking, parental
monitoring of adolescent drinking and the supply of alcohol to children by parents. Early
initiation to drinking significantly increases the risk for alcohol use problems in
adolescence and later life.
Evidence indicates that not all children raised in an environment characterised by
parental drinking problems necessarily go on to develop problems in their mental health
and well-being. A number of protective factors that buffer family members against the
potential negative effects of exposure to parental drinking have been identified. These
include high levels of family support, control and cohesion, a non-drinking parent or
caregiver who can mitigate the effects of the problem drinker, fewer socio-economic
stresses and the presence of social supports outside the family (e.g. school, friends and
the community). Drinking patterns also appear to be important, with out-of-home and
more stable drinking patterns being associated with better family functioning.

"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:79","CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
In this chapter, a series of conclusions are made based on themes that emerged in the
review. These conclusions aim to guide national policy and practice relevant to families
affected by alcohol use problems, and to provide directions for future research on
parental alcohol use disorders and related harms to Australian families.
Conclusion 1: The extent of harmful drinking patterns and alcohol use disorders
among Australian parents is significant.
There is only a small body of research on the epidemiology of alcohol use disorders and
drinking patterns among Australian parents. These data show that alcohol use is common
in Australian families. Harmful drinking patterns, such as frequent and risky drinking,
also appear to be reasonably common among adults responsible for the care of young
people. Alcohol abuse and dependence are less common among parents in the general
community, but are widespread among high-risk sub-groups of parents and caregivers
(e.g. parents of children in the out-of-home welfare system, or parents affected by
comorbid mental health and other substance use problems).
Epidemiological studies would help to ascertain the prevalence and incidence of parental
alcohol use disorders, including heavy and risky drinking patterns, as well as more
common patterns of alcohol use in the general community. Surveillance of changes in
parental use of alcohol would also help to assess the need for prevention and
intervention in Australian families, and to ascertain those groups in the community most
in need of information, support and treatment services.
Conclusion 2: Alcohol abuse is common among Indigenous Australians and has
frequently been linked to family violence.
While it is known that fewer Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians consume
alcohol, it has been shown that when they do drink they tend to consume alcohol at
riskier levels. It is unclear whether this pattern decreases significantly following the
transition to parenthood. There is also evidence that family violence occurs at elevated
rates in some Indigenous communities. While alcohol is likely to be linked to such
conflict and violence, its role is not clearly understood. Indeed, there is relatively limited
research on the impacts of parental alcohol use disorders on family functioning and
children in Indigenous communities. Thus, a range of issues remain poorly understood
and a greater investment in better understanding this area would appear to be crucial.
Conclusion 3: Parental alcohol use disorders are associated with a range of
problems in family life.
There is a large body of research showing significant associations between alcohol use
disorders in parents and problems in family life. These family-related problems include,
but are not limited to, marital and intimate partner relationship problems, family
dysfunction, comorbid substance use and mental health disorders in parents, disruptions
in parenting, and a range of negative outcomes in the health and well being of children
(e.g. birth defects, physical, psychological, emotional and behavioural disturbances,
cognitive delays and alcohol use problems). It is evident that problems in these areas
frequently co-occur in families where one or both parents have a drinking problem.
Evidence also suggests that there is considerable variability in the impact of parental
75"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:80","drinking problems from one family to another, and that this variability is influenced by
both the severity and frequency of parental drinking, as well as the presence of other
risks and protective factors. Families where both parents report alcohol abuse or
dependence, and those characterised by multiple risk factors, appear to be at greatest risk
for adverse outcomes in family life.
Conclusion 4: Consideration of a developmental perspective is important in
planning future policy and practice.
The findings of this review indicate that (a) there are numerous developmental pathways
via which alcohol use problems in parents can impact on family life, and (b) that alcohol
use problems in parents interact in complex and dynamic ways with other risks at
different stages of individual and family development. Taking a developmental approach
to understanding the effects of parental alcohol abuse and dependence acknowledges
that there are also multiple pathways and opportunities for intervention. It would be
helpful to better understand the effects of parental alcohol use disorders at different
stages of development because this knowledge has implications for how policy and
practice can best be tailored to Australian families at different developmental stages and
transition points. For instance, it appears that interventions at specific time points may be
warranted with different families (e.g. treatment for mothers drinking heavily in
pregnancy, promotion of healthy parent-infant relationships in infancy, and parent
education regarding monitoring and limit setting around adolescent alcohol use).
Conclusion 5: Treatment and intervention efforts should address the multiple
risks experienced by families affected by parental drinking problems.
There is emphasis in both the research world and among policy-makers on the
development of effective preventative interventions and treatments for parents and
families that are brief and economical. While such interventions may be suitable for
families experiencing less severe drinking problems or those characterised by few
compounding risk factors, families affected by multiple risk factors are likely to require
more intensive, longer-term and integrated support from community services and
treatment providers. Consistent with the developmental perspective, multiple
interventions with high-risk families at key points in development may be warranted.
Greater support is needed for these high-risk families to interrupt the trans-generational
cycle of problems that commonly occur in such families.
Conclusion 6: Prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk for a range of
physical, cognitive and mental health problems in children, including Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD). The question of whether there is a safe
level of drinking during pregnancy remains to be established.
Alcohol consumption at high levels during pregnancy, particularly chronic heavy alcohol
use or frequent heavy intermittent alcohol use, leads to a range of adverse outcomes in
children, including FASD. In Australia, the available evidence suggests that the birth
prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome is relatively small in the general community.
However, the syndrome appears to be a particular issue of concern among Indigenous
communities.
Survey data indicate that the majority of Australian women report a decrease in their use
of alcohol following conception. Despite this decrease, almost half of all women who are
pregnant and/or breastfeeding continue to drink alcohol. This is of concern because
there is some evidence that low-to-moderate levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy
may impact negatively on embryo and fetal development. The most likely effects at these
76"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:81","levels, if effects occur, are abnormalities in the developing embryo and subtle
neurobehavioral problems (e.g. evident by decreased psychomotor performance, verbal
learning and memory, and academic achievement). There appears to be some evidence
for a dose-response association; however, a threshold level below which consumption is
not teratogenic has not been established.
Given that many Australian women continue to drink during pregnancy, greater
investment in determining the impact of low-to-moderate drinking would appear to be
crucial. Knowledge of the effects of differences in the dosage and timing of drinking, and
the relative impact of maternal health and psychosocial factors on infant development,
would inform current guidelines and policy on the use of alcohol in pregnancy.
Conclusion 7: The early introduction of alcohol to children and young people by
parents may increase the risk for future drinking problems.
Many Australian parents educate their children about alcohol in what would appear to be
a safe manner, by introducing them to alcohol in a supervised environment around early
adolescence. Evidence indicates, however, that early initiation to alcohol can increase the
risk for future drinking problems, leading some researchers in the field to argue that
parents should delay children’s introduction to alcohol. The findings of this review reveal
that other factors may also play a role in this relationship. There is evidence, for example,
that adolescents who commence drinking at a young age and who subsequently go on to
misuse alcohol in late adolescence or adulthood, have been exposed to other familial and
social risks that, together with early exposure to drinking, increase the risk for adverse
outcomes. This risk would appear to be elevated among young people who live in home
environments that adopt generally permissive and encouraging attitudes to alcohol use.
Given the importance of this issue for Australian health policy, longitudinal research is
needed to determine whether early initiation is itself a key risk factor for the later
development of alcohol problems, or whether the presence of other factors, in
combination with early exposure, increases the risk for negative outcomes. An alternative
that also needs to be tested is whether early initiation is actually a marker for the presence
of other risks that account for the increased likelihood for developing alcohol use
problems. Teasing apart the relative contribution of early initiation to drinking from
other family and social risks will have important implications for parent education around
adolescent alcohol use and national policy in Australia.
Conclusion 8: The protective factors within families that minimise the negative
impact of parental alcohol use problems should be promoted.
Evidence indicates that not all children raised in an environment characterised by
parental drinking problems necessarily go on to develop problems in their mental health
and well-being. Compared to the large body of cross-sectional research examining the
risks associated with parental alcohol abuse and dependence, knowledge of factors that
buffer family members against the potential negative effects of exposure to parental
drinking is limited. Some factors that have been identified in the literature are high levels
of family support, control and cohesion, a non-drinking parent or caregiver who can
mitigate the effects of the problem drinker, fewer socio-economic stresses, child
resilience, and access to social supports outside the family (e.g. school, friends and the
community). Drinking patterns also appear to be important, with out-of-home and more
stable drinking patterns being associated with better family functioning. Greater
investment in understanding the protective factors within families and individuals that
77"
"The impact of alcohol use disorders on family life.pdf,page:82","minimise the negative impacts of parental alcohol use problems would assist in the
development of prevention and treatment interventions for Australian families.
Conclusion 9: More Australian research, especially longitudinal research, is
needed to promote understanding of the processes and developmental pathways
via which parental alcohol use impacts on family life.
This report indicates that we have a good understanding of the associations between
parental alcohol use disorders and problems in family life. However, the paucity of
Australian research in the field, especially longitudinal research, means that knowledge of
the complex pathways of influence is limited. At present, the international research is
relied upon to a large extent. Yet there are important differences in cultural norms and
attitudes, which may lessen the transferability of the international research to the
Australian context. There would be significant value from investing in more Australian
research on these issues.
Evidence presented in this review also highlights the need for a shift in research focus in
Australia – away from cross-sectional studies of association and toward carefully planned,
longitudinal research examining multiple pathways of influence at different stages of the
lifespan. Greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the complex interplay of
risk and protective factors, and the impact of interventions, over multiple developmental
stages. The undertaking of this kind of research will inevitably require greater
collaboration among groups with expertise in the alcohol and drug field, and among
expert researchers in areas such as developmental psychology, mental health, medicine
and economics. This kind of large-scale collaborative research in Australia will improve
knowledge of the complex pathways via which parental alcohol use disorders impact on
family life and children and will guide the development of effective preventative and
treatment interventions. Such research will directly inform national policy decisions
relating to the health and well-being of Australian families.
A short-term valuable way forward is to capitalise on the existing Australian cohort
studies to better understand pathways of influence and family-related impact across time.
While this approach will provide short-term advances, it is important to acknowledge
that the existing available data sources in Australia do not have sufficiently detailed
information to answer the more complex questions raised. For this reason, a longer-term
investment is also recommended. This would involve investment the establishment and
maintenance of a cohort of Australian parents to determine the impact of alcohol use on
family functioning and children, including the role of mental health, psychosocial and
protective factors discussed in this report.

Foreword
IIn September 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated version of
the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, which provided an in-depth situation analysis
of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harms, and control policies at the global level. It also
presented country profiles that included key indicators.
This regional report complements the WHO 2018 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health
by presenting a comprehensive picture of alcohol consumption in the Region of the Ameri-
cas, the related health and social consequences of harmful alcohol use, and how countries are
responding. This regional report discusses the impact of the harmful use of alcohol on popu-
lation health and identifies evidence-based strategies to protect and promote the health and
well-being of communities the Americas. The data have been validated by each country of
origin for the WHO global report, and this regional report additionally includes subsequent
studies that were not discussed in the earlier global report. The overarching goal of the analy-
ses presented is to provide an update on alcohol policies in the Americas and identify gaps and
challenges, as well as to discuss how countries can improve current trends in alcohol consump-
tion and attributable harm, in expeditious and cost-effective ways.
Alcohol-related harms have been neglected for too long in the Americas, while lives are being
lost and individuals, families and communities continue to suffer the direct or indirect conse-
quences. The harmful use of alcohol worsens the already large and growing social and eco-
nomic disparities in our Region. It is clear that strong political commitment is needed to bring
all sectors together, to ensure that health is placed ahead of commercial interests. Urgent ac-
tion must be taken to prevent current and future generations from suffering the high health,
economic and social costs of harmful alcohol consumption. It is time to deliver and make our
communities SAFER, by implementing cost-effective policies and protecting the public health.

Alcohol per capita consumption
A measure of a country’s alcohol consumption that accounts for
its number of people. It describes alcohol consumption for the
average person.
It divides the amount of alcohol consumed by population:

Box 1. Tourist deaths from illicit alcohol in the Dominican Republic
Tourism comprises just under 10% of the Dominican Republic’s gross domestic product, and roughly 1 in 13
people are employed in the hospitality industry through jobs at hotels, restaurants or bars (24). In the year
spanning 2018-2019, newspapers reported that there were 10 tourist deaths reportedly linked to contami-
nated alcohol accessed via swim-up bars or hotel minibars at resorts across the Dominican Republic (25). In
addition, more than a dozen additional visitors reported serious illnesses with symptoms similar to those who
perished (25). Those who passed away suffered from heart attacks, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and
vomiting blood (26).
While most unrecorded alcohol poses no health risk over and above the ethanol content, there can be epi-
demics of illness, and sometimes death, associated with batches of adulterated alcohol (23). A forensic scien-
tist reported that the tourists’ symptoms were consistent with pesticide or methanol poisoning. Methanol
(also called methyl alcohol) is a type of alcohol that is commonly used to create commodity chemicals such as
antifreeze and windshield wiper fluid. It is very difficult to tell apart methanol from ethanol by smell or taste.
However, methanol is much more toxic than ethanol as the human body is less efficient in processing meth-
anol than ethanol. After ingestion, liver enzymes convert methanol byproducts into formic acid, which can
cause the body to shut down. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning can occur with smaller volumes of methanol
(e.g., 2-8 ounces) than ethanol because the body is more efficient at breaking down and clearing ethanol from
the body. Methanol poisoning is the second most severe health risk of consumption of illicit/informal alcohol
(after ethanol) (23), and these localized outbreaks may spark fear among travelers. However, methanol deaths
account for less than 0.1% of all alcohol-attributable deaths and the vast majority of alcohol poisonings and
harm is caused by ethanol alone (23).

Box 2. PAHO tool to calculate APC
Data on recorded APC can be collected and reported by a country’s statistical office using the APC of alcohol tool
developed by the Pan American Health Organization. Data on alcohol production, importation and exportation
are needed, at a minimum, to estimate recorded APC of alcohol. The accuracy of adult per capita consumption
of alcohol estimates can be increased by including additional data, such as on alcohol re-exports and additional
stock. These data should be measured either in overall volume of pure alcohol (i.e., ethanol) or overall volume
of production, imports and exports, in each case by beverage type. If data on overall volume of pure alcohol
by beverage type is used, then the percentage of alcohol by volume will be required. Examples of common
percentages (i.e., strengths) include beer (barley beer 5%), wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth
(16%), spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified
wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). However, the per-
centage of alcohol by volume may vary by country. In some cases, country specific data can be used to increase
data accuracy, such as a specific alcohol by volume for malt beer (4.61%) and gin (42%) in Mexico.

Alcohol-attributable death: deaths that are caused by alcohol.
Alcohol-attributable fraction: the percentage of an outcome (e.g., injuries, cancer deaths) that are caused
by alcohol use.
Disability-adjusted life year (DALY): a measure of overall diseases burden combining two types of years:
1) the years of life lost (YLL) when a person dies prematurely, and 2) the years lived with disability (YLD) due

Years of life lost (YLL): the total number of years of potential life that are lost when a person dies
prematurely.
Years lived with disability (YLD): the total number of years lived with any short- or long-term loss of health

of years lived with a condition by disability weights, which estimate the level of disability from a range of

Box 4. Types of policies
Interventions and policies may focus on several type(s) of populations and identifying the target for a given
intervention or policy can help determine whether it is an appropriate response for a given problem (see
Figure 32). Universal policies affect the entire population. These population-wide strategies often aim to
prevent consumption and related problems before they occur such as national alcohol excise taxes, mini-
mum legal purchase ages, regulations of hours of sale, and advertising restrictions. Selective interventions
and policies also aim to prevent potentially harmful alcohol use but they restrict their focus to specific sub-
group(s) that are at a higher risk (e.g., youth, college students). Examples of selective alcohol policies are
screening for alcohol problems on college campuses and establishing lower blood alcohol concentration
limits for novice drivers. Finally, indicated interventions and policies focus on smaller population groups
either to reduce the harm from alcohol among those already harmed in some way, or to separate the drink-
ing from other risks or harms. The goal of indicated approaches is to treat problems early and prevent future
problems and complications. For example, alcohol treatment for persons who are dependent on alcohol,
drink-driving countermeasures such as alcohol ignition interlocks are examples of indicated interventions
related to alcohol.

Box 5. Beer and sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in Latin America
Most countries in Latin America tax beer and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), two beverages associated
with public health harms, but these taxes are often designed to provide revenue rather than achieve public
health goals (122). Mexico’s introduction of a peso-per-liter excise tax on SSBs in 2014 demonstrated the po-
tential gains that are possible with taxes; consumption fell by 5.5% in the first year and an additional 9.7% in
the second year (123, 124). Even though most countries in Latin America tax beer and SSBs, consumption of
these beverages is on the rise. Between 2012 and 2016, 13 Latin American countries witnessed annual increas-
es in beer consumption around 2.9%, which exceeded increases in population growth (1.2%) (125, 126). This
apparent disconnect prompted a recent investigation into whether taxes on beer and SSBs were controlling
the affordability of these beverages in Latin America over time by calculating annual changes in the relative
price for 15 countries (127).
Affordability of beer remained held constant or increased in most Latin American countries (see Figure 33)
(127). Paraguay, Brazil, El Salvador, Uruguay, Chile, Costa Rica, Argentina and Peru saw no change in the af-
fordability of beer over the study period (127). Affordability increased at an annual average rate of 1.4% in
Honduras, 5.3% in Guatemala, 7.3% in Ecuador, and 4.1% in Colombia (127). It also decreased each year by
5.0% in the Dominican Republic, 4.1% in Bolivia, and 1.2% in Mexico (127).

As countries in the Americas develop, many are experiencing dramatic increases in the burden of non-
communicable diseases. Consequently, many are considering taxes on commodities that are associated with
the behavioral drivers of non-communicable diseases. In 2018, Peru became one of the first to enact pricing
policies designed to curb this emerging epidemic (134). They raised taxes on alcoholic beverages that were
at least 20% alcohol as part of a policy focused on drivers of noncommunicable diseases: tobacco, alcohol,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and motor vehicles with high pollution (134). In a time of declining resources
for health care and rising consumption of harmful products, the motivation for these taxes were two-fold:
they aimed to reverse trends of increasing use while also creating new revenue streams to fund additional
treatment and prevention initiatives. Non-communicable diseases that result from alcohol, tobacco, obesity,
and pollution cost Peru roughly $24 billion per year, which is roughly 11% of their gross domestic product
(GDP) (135). By comparison, the Peruvian government spends about 3.7% of their GDP on health care.

Box 7. Justifications for alcohol policies
There are two common justifications to implement alcohol control policies. The first assumes that consumers
are unable to accurately predict the dangers of drinking alcohol, both for themselves and others, because
drinkers are unaware of many of the risks of alcohol use. This implies that there is a market failure, because
consumers may purchase and consume more alcohol than they would if they were fully informed about
the potential risks of alcohol use. In this sense, alcohol control policies aim to correct for this market failure
and better align knowledge and behavior. In an extension of this perspective, youth tend to underestimate
how much harm their actions will cause and incorrectly forecast how they will feel about their choices in the
future. Following this logic, additional protections to reduce and prevent alcohol use by youth would also
better align their consumption with potential harms.
The other way to justify policies that increase the price tag for alcoholic beverages is to aim to offset the
societal harms from alcohol use. In economics, these harms are called “negative externalities,” which are
harms or costs borne by someone other than the drinker. While alcohol sales can be lucrative for the alcohol
and hospitality industries (among others), the costs to society can also accumulate, leading to sizable differ-
ences between government revenues and liabilities. For example, in the United States, the average drinker
pays $0.03 (for beer and wine) $0.05 (for spirits) in government taxes for one drink (140), but each drink costs
the government $0.87 (116). These costs accumulate through additional burdens in health care (16.8%), lost
productivity (56.8%), criminal justice costs (23.9%), fire losses (2.1%) and special education for fetal alcohol
syndrome (0.3%) (116).

"REGIONAL STATUS REPORT ON ALCOHOL AND HEALTH IN THE AMERICAS 2020.pdf,page:77","Box 8. Building capacity to screen for AUDs in Colombia, Mexico and Peru
Screening and brief intervention (SBI) is an effective individual-level approach that is of critical importance
when developing multi-level policy solutions to combat alcohol-related harms. Despite robust evidence of
effectiveness, few countries implement SBI widely as a component of routine medical care. The potential
benefits from expanding the use of SBI are high: one study estimated that increasing the uptake of SBI to 30%
was estimated to yield a 10-15% reduction in the harmful use of alcohol and a 5-14% decline in the incidence
of alcohol dependence (163). The low utilization rates are often attributed to barriers such as cost of provider
training, burden on providers to discuss and make recommendations to patients, and exclusive focus on pro-
viders, rather than how health care structures inhibit or encourage SBI uptake.
Box 9. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Screening Tool in Population
Surveys
WHO developed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to assess the risk posed by a per-
son’s alcohol use in a timely and cost-effective way. The purpose is to screen for hazardous and harmful
patterns of alcohol consumption and risk of alcohol use disorder. The information can provide immediate
feedback and advice on the next steps, as appropriate. The AUDIT is comprised of three domains: hazardous
alcohol use, dependence symptoms, and harmful use of alcohol. Each question is scored using a range of 0-4
where larger values indicate more harmful patterns of consumption. After completing the AUDIT, the scores
for each item are added, and total scores of 8 or higher are indicative of a risk of health and other problems
is the consumption does not change or escalate. A health care provider can use the distribution to discuss
the specific pattern of an individual, to how where they fit along the spectrum. However, the AUDIT is not a
diagnostic tool, and persons who have a score of a 20+ may or may not meet clinical criteria for an AUD.

Alcohol is a leading contributor to many of the leading causes of death among young adults in Mexico, in-
cluding road traffic injuries and interpersonal violence. This burden led the state administration and State
Commissioner for Protection against Health Risks to declare alcohol prevention a leading priority. One way
this commitment materialized was when the Chamber of Deputies dedicated November 15 as a day for
awareness of the harms associated with alcohol. This new holiday was celebrated for the first time in 2018,
and alcohol awareness activities occurred in all 31 Mexican states (164). The celebration included a range of in-
teractive activities, including a march from Durango to La Laguna, educational materials describing the acute
and chronic harms of alcohol use, and workshops for youth such as “Zero deaths from alcohol at the wheel”
(165, 166). Focusing on preventing alcohol-related harms to youth, as the motto for the inaugural event was,
“Not a single drink to minors,” and activities promoted awareness of the compliance monitoring for underage
alcohol sales that are included in the National Strategy for the Prevention of Alcoholic Beverage Consumption
among Minors (166).

Box 11. Feedback on the role of the alcohol industry during the regional
consultation
During the regional consultation in 2019, a clear consensus emerged that alcohol industry involvement was
impeding alcohol policy development. A common and shared concern was that there were few opportunities
within the scope of their role to document this interference. In addition, this interference was allowed to con-
tinue because other government officials and the public sector are unaware of the alcohol industry’s conflict
of interest with public health. In other instances, government officials who were responsible for developing
alcohol policy were involved with the alcohol industry and had financial conflicts of interest themselves. As
evidence of the consequences of this interference, several participants offered examples of ways that the
alcohol environment is currently tilted in the alcohol industry’s favor. For example, they pay far less in taxes
than the burden of alcohol on society, vulnerable groups are overexposed to alcohol advertising, and mar-
keting messages are not verified for scientific accuracy and can mislead the public and government officials.
In response to this interference, the focal points from Ministries of Health from the Region requested that a
set of guidelines be developed that clearly outlines the appropriate roles and responsibilities for the alcohol
industry. In addition, they requested that technical support in measuring and determining methods to limit
industry interference be provided.

AND HEALTH
IN THE AMERICAS 2020
This report is designed to complement the WHO’s 2018 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health by providing
greater detail on the current status on alcohol consumption, harms, barriers, and breakthroughs in the Region of
the Americas in relation to alcohol’s impact on health and the associated burden of disease.
This is the third regional report dedicated to alcohol and health in the Americas. The information provided is based
on country responses to the WHO Global Survey on Alcohol and Health, undertaken in 2016, which informed the
WHO Global Report of 2018. Data were reviewed and accepted by each country before the publication of the global
report and the information used for the regional report largely relies on the global information system on alcohol
and health (GISAH) of the WHO.
The report provides an update on alcohol consumption in the region and each Member State, trends in consump-
tion over time, alcohol-related harms, and current alcohol policies being implemented in each Member State and to
what extent they are in line with the WHO global alcohol strategy and regional plan of action. It provides examples
of studies done in the Region that were not reported in the WHO Global Status Report. The report discusses gaps
and challenges in reducing the harmful use of alcohol and how countries can reverse current trends in a cost-ef-
fective and expedited way, particularly if the WHO SAFER technical package is implemented at the national level.

Measuring Alcohol Consumption in the
United States
Methods and Rationales
ROBIN ROOM
1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter lays out the methods of measuring alcohol consumption that have been used
in survey studies of the general population of the United States and discusses their
development and rationales. As was already clear by 1970 (Room, 1970b), there are two
major strategies for asking respondents about their current pattern of drinking: (1) asking
them to list all recent drinking occasions; and (2) asking them to summarize their current
patterns. In general terms, British and Scandinavian researchers have followed the first
strategy, while North American researchers have followed the second (see Room, 1977,
and Auth and Warheit, 1982/83, on U.S. traditions). Recently, some European re
searchers have challenged U.S. traditions of measuring drinking patterns, arguing in
favor of the ""recent occasions"" approach (Duffy, 1982, 1984; Alanko, 1984). On the
other hand, a recent empirical analysis of Finnish data concluded that' 'for most descrip
tive purposes"" on a population level, ""the choice of measurement procedure is irrele
vant,"" and furthermore that an approach in the U.S. tradition may least underestimate
consumption among the heaviest drinkers (Simpura, 1987). These discussions and anal
yses, along with recent discussions by U.S. researchers (e.g., Greenfield, 1986;
Knupfer, 1987a, 1987b), do remind us of ""the extremely complicated structure of the
concept of alcohol consumption"" (Alanko, 1984, p. 209) and of the need for new
developmental work taking account of the different national traditions. As Alanko
concludes, our ""awareness of the problems"" in existing approaches ""should stimulate
further research leading to improved methodology"" (p. 224).
In sketching the history and development of measurements of the amount of drink
ing in North American surveys, this chapter focuses on surveys of the general adult

population, although, as noted below, two other quantititative research traditions
studies of teenage drinking and studies of amount of drinking among clinical alco
holics-have intersected with the tradition of adult drinking practices surveys. Our
attention is on the logic and procedures of measurement and of aggregation for report
ing; readers are referred elsewhere for general reviews on the validity of measures of
alcohol consumption (Pernanen, 1974, Midanik, 1982).
2. NORTH AMERICAN APPROACHES TO MEASURING AMOUNT
OF DRINKING
Methodological discussions of the best way to measure drinking patterns and
problems date back at least to Pearl's discussion (1926, pp. 69-92) of the importance of
separating steady daily drinkers from occasional heavy drinkers. Until the 1950s, how
ever, surveys of the general population confined themselves to simple distinctions
between drinking and abstaining (e.g., Gallup, 1972; Billings, 1903) or by frequency of
drinking (Riley and Marden, 1947). The crucial step in moving to a fuller measurement
of alcohol consumption was to start asking also about amount of drinking on an occasion
or in a given period of time.
In this sense, the modem North American tradition of questions on amount of
drinking starts with Straus and Bacon's path-breaking study (1953) of Drinking in
College. Straus and Bacon's approach to measuring patterns of drinking was to ask, for
each type of beverage (wine, beer, and spirits), the frequency of drinking and the
average amount ordinarily consumed at a sitting (see Fig. I). A similar method was
adopted in the Iowa general-population studies of Mulford and associates, starting in the
late 1950s (Fitzgerald and Mulford, 1982; their 1979 survey specified the time period
covered to the last 30 days). Variations on this method have been widely used (Fig. 2).
Meanwhile, a separate tradition, starting with the San Francisco Bay Area studies
of the California Drinking Practices Study in the early 1960s (Knupfer et aI., 1963;
Knupfer and Room, 1964), asked, for each beverage type, the frequency of drinking and
then the proportion of drinking occasions on which one or two drinks, three or four

version, like many versions coming in the wake of NIAAA's treatment evaluation studies (Polich
and Orvis, 1979; Armor and Polich, 1982), uses a 1-month time base. The original Straus and
Bacon and Mulford and Miller studies used an implicit 1-year time base."

The focus of this chapter is women's criminal behavior related to drug use. This
includes the woman's role as a consumer of illicit drugs, as a potential distributor (seller,
dealer) in the illegal market, and as an offender if she is arrested for drug possession or
trafficking. The first area of investigation considers women primarily as experimenters
or recreational users of illicit drugs.
Also considered are the crimes, mainly prostitution, that addicted women are
thought to commit in order to obtain drugs. Indeed, the limitations of available research
are highlighted in Adler and Simon's comment that ""what research has been done on
females and drugs has been largely within the purview of the literature on prostitution""
(1979, p. 99). Therefore, this second group of studies is centered on female addiction as
a cause or consequence of other criminal activities.
By way of introduction, we want to explore why the issue of legality, as opposed to
illegality, is central to understanding female substance use. At the tum of the century, in

the United States, twice as many women as men were addicted to opiate narcotics
(Cuskey et aI., 1972). The Harrison Act of 1914, which made narcotics illegal, shifted
that ratio, and from approximately 1920 onward, male addicts outnumbered females by
nearly two to one (Ferrence and Whitehead, 1980). What had been acceptable, or at
least tolerated, quasimedical use became a forbidden activity.
A further example comes from Britain, where the medical model of addiction
remained dominant until the 1960s (Trebach, 1982). Prior to 1962, the majority of
British opiate addicts were women; since then, with increased emphasis on repression
and control (i.e., heroin use has become a more deviant activity), male addicts have
outnumbered females (d'Orban, 1970). Currently, in most Western countries, men are
the heaviest users of cocaine, heroin, phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, and other prohib
ited substances (Colten and Marsh, 1984; Ferrence, 1984). Men are also more likely
than women to use alcohol and tobacco and to use them more frequently (Ferrence,
1984). Female drug use exceeds male use only for the medicinal and legal mood
modifying drugs, i.e., tranquilizers, barbiturates, and over-the-counter drugs (Cooper
stock, 1976), and then only when obtained by prescription. Men dominate in illicit
consumption, but overall drug consumption may not be very different for men and
women (Kalant, 1980).
Female illicit drug users are doubly deviant. Not only do they break the law, they
also participate in a predominantly male activity (Ferrence and Whitehead, 1980). It is
instructive to examine the parallel course in the explanation of female deviance in the
criminology literature. Female criminals have been variously described over the past 80
years as ""devious, deceitful and emotional ... intellectually dull and passive ...
closer to animals in evolution ... immoral ... lonely and dependent ... [and] a pa-
thetic lot"" (Klein and Kress, 1976, p. 35). The deviant behavior of males and females
was assumed to reflect different underlying processes and motivations (Smith and Pater
noster, 1987). While men have been viewed as seeking monetary success, status, or peer
acceptance through criminal pursuits, their female counterparts have been portrayed as
personally or socially maladjusted or as the victims of biological imbalance (Smith and
Paternoster, 1987). The current trend is away from gender-specific theories of deviance,
toward more comprehensive explanations of deviant behavior in both males and females
(see Hagan et aI., 1985).
Men far outnumber women as perpetrators of crime and especially as committers of
more serious and violent offences (Silverman, 1982). In the 1970s, a renewed interest in
female crime provoked a flood of studies which assessed the convergence hypothesis
the notion that women were becoming more like men in the frequency and nature of
offending. Adler's Sisters in Crime (1975) promoted the image of a new violent female
criminal. Simon's (1979) assessment of arrest statistics for the period 1953-1974 indi
cated, however, that increases in female crime were concentrated in the category of
property offenses. A more recent analysis (Steffensmeier, 1987) showed that this trend
continued to 1985 (i.e., of increased female involvemen! in larceny, fraud, embezzle
ment, and forgery but not in violent, personal crime). The assessment of sex differences
in crime occupies many researchers and is reviewed elsewhere (Adler and Simon,
1979). We tum now to our main topic-sex differences in illicit drug use-and consider
recent evidence from surveys and community studies."

The Origi ns of Modern Research and
Responses Relevant to Problems of Alcohol
A Brief History of the First Center of Alcohol Studies
MARK KELLER
Because alcohol had sometimes been used as an anesthetic, it came to be studied in the
Laboratory of Applied Physiology at Yale University by the great physiologist Yandell
Henderson and his associate Howard W. Haggard as one of the drugs of interest for the
alleviation of pain.
1. THE 19305
Beginning in the early 1930s, researchers in this laboratory published a series of
important papers on the effects of alcohol. After the law in the United States that had
prohibited commerce in alcoholic beverages was rescinded in 1933, a widespread re
newed public concern about alcohol developed, especially over its effects on drinkers.
The Laboratory at Yale then began to receive many requests for ""scientific"" knowledge
about alcohol. Haggard, who had succeeded Henderson as Professor of Physiology and
Director of the Laboratory, realized that he and the other physiologists and biochemists
on his staff did not have the knowledge to answer many of the inquiries, which involved
social, psychological, and even economic and political issues. Alcohol in drink was not
just a physicochemical substance.
Although Haggard had graduated from the Yale Medical School with the M.D.
degree, he had not chosen to practice as a physician. His interests were in research and
education. Thus, he broadcast the first unsponsored public radio program on health and
authored the popular Devils, Drugs and Doctors. When, in 1937, the Research Council
on Problems of Alcohol was formed, he was invited to serve on its Scientific Advisory
Committee. He supported the Council in obtaining a grant, from the Carnegie Corpora-

tion, for a review of the biological literature on effects of alcohol. The grant was then
assigned to the New York University College of Medicine, where the staff of Norman
Jolliffe had already begun some preliminary documentation in the desired direction.
Jolliffe was therefore named Medical Director of the review project.
Jolliffe's first step was destined to have enormous influence on everything con
nected with alcohol and alcoholism-in research and education, public attitudes, and
treatment-that would happen in the next 50 years or more: He drove from New York
City to Worcester, Massachusetts, and there persuaded E. M. Jellinek to become the
executive director of the projected review.
With the documentalist from Jolliffe's staff at his right hand, and a newly hired
staff of multilingual abstractors-mostly physicians and psychologists-and with the
resources especially of the library of the New York Academy of Medicine, Jellinek
completed the essential review task in some 16 months (September 1939-December
1940). A vast volume offacts had been abstracted and systematically entered in a newly
designed, subject-indexed, mechanically retrievable archive. But the grant fund was
exhausted, and many months of work remained to be done in writing and editing the
review.
2. THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
It was Howard W. Haggard who demonstrated the foresight and capacity to solve
this problem. While the project was hardly midway, in early 1940, he founded, at Yale
in the Laboratory of Applied Physiology, the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol.
The Journal would provide, among other contents, a medium for publication of the
emerging reports from the review then in progress (Jellinek and Jolliffe, 1940; Jellinek
and McFarland, 1940). Now he invited Jellinek to come to Yale, with his staff, there to
complete the review. Haggard, perhaps the most popular professor at Yale, * was able to
raise the financial support for this costly undertaking among alumni families. He had in
mind, however, that members of the review staff would participate in other work at the
Laboratory. t
Work in formulating reviews, especially of the medical aspects of the effects of
alcohol, progressed steadily. They were published in the first two volumes of the
Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol (1940-1942) and assembled in a volume
published by Yale University Press (Jellinek, 1942a).
While the grand literature review and some research on drugs other than alcohol
absorbed Jellinek at first, he did not neglect the wider interest in alcohol of Haggard, his
boss, and of the Research Council, where he was now vice-chairman of the Scientific

tlndeed, lellinek there designed an ingenious study of the effects of various drugs, used in combination
in commercial ""pain killers"" (other than alcohol), which proved of great value to pharmaceutical
manufacturers as well as to the Laboratory. Historically, it is possible that this was the first ""double
blind"" experiment (Jellinek, 1946). In addition, both Martin Gross and Giorgio Lolli ofthe review staff
became regular participants in the physiological researches at the Laboratory. Other staff who followed
lellinek to Yale and participated in the alcohol-related developments were Gertrude Gross, a psychia
trist, Anne Roe, a psychologist, and Vera Efron and Mark Keller, documentalists."

Alcohol and the Family
An International Review of the Literature with
Implications for Research and Practice
JIM ORFORD
1. INTRODUCTION
In 1982 the present author wrote for WHO a paper entitled, ""The Prevention and
Management of Alcohol Problems in the Family Setting: A Review of Work Carried out
in English-Speaking Countries. "" This was subsequently published in Alcohol and Alco
holism in 1983 (Orford, 1983). The present chapter represents an update of that earlier
paper with an extension to cover literature from other countries and literature written in
languages other than English.
Work from Britain, the United States, Canada, and Australia has been excluded
from this review unless (1) the work was published since the earlier review was being
prepared and it added substantially to the earlier literature, or (2) it referred to the
indigenous, or nonwhite, population in one of those countries, or (3) its inclusion in the
review was necessary in order to make a point that could not be made easily in any other
way.
Otherwise an attempt has been made to review comprehensively the literature on
alcohol and the family from around the world. Although the review is based on a
computer literature search of Psychological Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social
Science Research, Medline, Excerpta Medica, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bu
reaux, plus a personal search of a wide range of recent journals available at the Univer
sity of Exeter, there is no doubt that some relevant literature has been missed. More
serious is the possibility that a whole perspective on the subject is missing. The author is
conscious of the fact that a variety of widely divergent perspectives on this subject can be
adopted-the social and cultural view of Section 4 is very different from the family

psychology and psychiatry perspective of most of Section 2, for example. An econo
mist, historian, or political scientist might have written a review with a very different
balance. No doubt a psychogeneticist would have tackled this task in yet a different way.
A number of non-English language papers were translated into English for the
reviewer. These are indicated in the reference list. This review also draws on a helpful
summary of Eastern European work prepared for WHO by Boyadjieva (undated). In the
case of all other non-English language work, this review has had to rely on abstracts.
The organization of the review into four main subsections was dictated by the
material available. The largest amount fell into the following two subsections: marriage
in disorder and distress, and intergenerational effects. This reflects the predominance of
Western models of research on the nuclear family, the recent expansion of interest in the
intergenerational transmission of drinking problems, particularly in the United States,
and the concern in Eastern European countries over the socialization of youth and the
increasing rate of family breakdown. Section 4, on social and cultural studies, has a
much more even worldwide coverage, with work from Africa particularly well repre
sented. Nevertheless, the amount of material with an alcohol focus is relatively small.
Once again, Section 5, on prevention and treatment in the family setting, is dominated
by work from the West. In particular, this reviewer discovered next to no work on the
prevention and treatment of alcohol problems in the family outside Europe or North
America. The final section considers the implications for future intervention and
research.
2. MARRIAGES IN DISORDER AND DISTRESS
This section examines the findings of research that has focused on marriages that
are disordered or distressed as a result of, or in association with, excessive drinking.
Most of this work is about the marriages of alcoholics or problem drinkers and is carried
out within the Western tradition of family psychology, psychiatry, or social work. The
section begins with those studies that most clearly view marriage partners as victims of
the stress associated with excessive drinking in a family member. It considers the nature
of this stress and focuses in particular on marital violence and on separation and divorce
(child abuse and neglect, and stress on children, are considered separately, in Section 3).
This section then considers what is known about how partners cope with excessive
drinking. This leads to a consideration of those studies that have taken an interactional or
systems, rather than stress victim, perspective on alcohol and the family.
Marital Hardship
For many years, studies from the United States (e.g., Bailey et aI., 1962; Jackson
and Kogan, 1963; Lemert, 1962; Moos and Moos, undated) and Britain (e.g., Orford et
aI., 1976) have been reporting that women married to men with identified drinking
problems often describe a great deal of severe and long-lasting hardship (including
economic insecurity, social embarrassment, reduction of social contact, failure of the
husband to meet role obligations, roWs and quarrels, a poor sex life and infidelity,"

Prolonged alcohol intake for many years has been known to cause serious ailments in human beings since
time memorial. Even after knowing that this dangerous addiction paves the way to one’s own grave, there
isn’t much difference in the way the community sees this deadly habit. Time and again history has proven
that this fatal addiction could make the life of those who consume it terrible. Also, the lives of the dear ones
of alcoholic people are affected as alcohol not only affects those who consume them but also kin and friends.
Various research studies conducted over many years clearly show the association of prolonged alcohol intake
in the causation, aggravation, worsening, and deterioration of the health of its consumers. Moreover,
chronic alcohol intake single-handedly is one of the major etiological factors in various serious diseases.

Introduction And Background
Through the ages, alcoholism has been undisputedly maintaining its position in the list of risk factors for
preventable diseases in the world. According to a WHO report, 5.3% of all deaths that occurred worldwide in
the year 2016 were because of harmful alcohol use [1]. It is the main culprit behind the advancing nature of
many chronic diseases. It drastically increases the severity of diseases and also makes the treatments less
effective. Alcohol not only affects the person physiologically, but it has many adverse effects psychologically
and socially too. Also, the habit of alcoholism leads to huge expenses [2]. Apart from systemic involvement,
which causes various clinical manifestations, there are certain signs and symptoms that are most of the
times non-specific and that as such don’t point out or say lead to a particular diagnosis, such as nausea,
agitation, vomiting, anxiety, diaphoresis, tremors, headache, visual hallucinations, tachycardia, seizures,
delirium, temperature elevation, etc. It is not always necessary that these mentioned signs and symptoms
are compulsorily linked with disease conditions.
Alcohol clearly plays a very important role in making many other diseases progress to their advanced stages.
It has been also noted that alcohol intake and its related disorders are often associated with many other
manifestations; for example, patients with alcoholic neuropathy often have associated nutritional
deficiencies. Recent studies have clearly proved that alcoholism is associated with many types of cancers too
and this understanding of alcoholism has spurred research minds all over the globe to find out the exact
pathophysiology behind the same. Alcohol is a very easily available source of addiction, which is one of the
main reasons why it remains a serious threat to the community. There is a huge variety that is available as
far as alcoholic drinks are concerned. Alcohol is also one of the cheaply accessible means of addiction; this
explains why alcoholism is so prevalent. A person may initially start consuming alcohol in very low amounts
most probably with just a desire to try it, but once he or she gets addicted, then getting rid of the habit
becomes extremely difficult. Even if a person is mentally resolute enough to quit alcoholism, his or her body,
which has been modified because of the chronic use of alcohol, won’t be up to the challenge anytime soon;
he or she has to overcome many hurdles put forward by the body, which could in an umbrella term be
referred to as alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
There are many social stigmas associated with alcohol intake. Most people get into this addiction by getting
inspired by the people whom they admire, like actors, celebrities, role models, etc. Also, exposure to the
sight of family members, relatives and friends drinking alcohol has a huge impact on one’s mindset as he or
she may take it to be something that is normal. In the long run, most of the time, even without their
realization, people get pathetically trapped in this dangerous fatal habit of alcoholism, which eventually
makes their lives pitiful in almost all aspects. Studies have shown that alcohol is also a key player in many
other domains too like accidents, suicide, depression, hallucinations, violence, memory disturbances, etc.
The main purpose of this review article is to enable any person reading this article to get a comprehensive
insight into the effects of alcohol on the various systems of the human body, and for the same, many
recognized research articles published in numerous well-acknowledged journals across the globe are
reviewed. The article is written using very basic and simple terminologies so that even a layperson who

systems, framing the review like a discussion section of an article where details are explained in simple and

Review
Impact of alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS)
Alcohol exerts various effects on our CNS in various ways, the common ones being depression of the CNS,
destruction of the brain cells, contraction of the tissues of the brain, suppression of the excitatory nerve
pathway activity, neuronal injury, etc [3]. Alcohol’s impact on the functioning of the brain ranges from mild
and anxiolytic disinhibitory effects, motor incoordination, sedation, emesis, amnesia, hypnosis and
ultimately unconsciousness [4]. The synaptic transmission is heavily disturbed and altered by ethanol, and
the intrinsic excitability in various areas of the brain is also compromised. The effects of ethanol may be
pre-synaptic, post-synaptic, and at times, non-synaptic too. Alcohol being a psychotropic depressant of the
CNS exerts a deeply profound impact on the neurons, which alters the biological and behavioural well-being
of the one who consumes it by the promotion of interference in various neuronal pathways [5]. The
treatments of many disorders of the CNS are shown to be affected by the consumption of alcohol, and thus,
it is generally advised to keep oneself away from alcohol if one is undergoing treatment for any CNS
manifestations, like anxiety or mood disorders [6].
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is chronic in nature and is characterized by uncontrolled drinking and also a
preoccupation with alcohol. The severity of AUD is a crucial factor in how it is going to affect the human
body. AUD can be mild, moderate, or severe according to the symptoms a person experiences. The clinical
manifestations of AUD include signs and symptoms such as inability to control the amount of alcohol intake,
spending a lot of time drinking, feeling an uncontrollable craving for alcohol, loss of interest in social
activities, failure to fulfil tasks within the time provided, etc. Most of the time, along with the person who
consumes alcohol, several other factors are also to be taken care of in order to effectively manage alcohol-
related health conditions. These factors can be social, environmental, genetic, psychological, etc, which
make a considerable impact on how alcohol affects the behaviour and body of those consuming it. Binge
drinking, i.e., drinking to such an extent on a single occasion that the blood alcohol concentration level
becomes 0.08% or more, is a very relevant aspect of alcohol intake, which has to be dealt with, with utmost
urgency. Certain research studies suggest that mild to moderate alcohol intake provides a certain sort of
protection against a few CNS disorders like dementia, ischemia of neurons, etc, but this in no way should
encourage the community in promoting alcohol intake as in reality, it is very difficult to remain within the
limits of mild to moderate alcohol intake, and thus, eventually, people do end up as full-time severe alcohol
abusers. Epilepsy, a seizure disorder caused by disturbed nerve cell activity in the brain, aggravates on
excessive alcohol intake as alcohol increases the frequency of seizures in patients of epilepsy [7]. The issue
becomes more severe in those epileptic patients who have refractory forms of epilepsy. As far as
comorbidities are concerned, a valid history of abuse of substances or alcohol dependence is believed to be
strongly associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) [8]. Heavy alcohol

"Effects of Alcohol Consumption on Various Systems of the Human BodyA Systematic Review.pdf,page:3","drinking over a long period of time has been found to have an intensely negative undesirable effect on the
autonomic nervous system too.
Impact of alcohol on the cardiovascular system (CVS)
Chronic alcohol intake is undoubtedly a very important risk factor as far as cardiovascular diseases are
concerned and several clinical trials do point out this fact. The results of several research studies conducted
in various settings clearly indicate that increased intake of alcohol has increased adverse effects on our heart
and its vasculature. Alcohol exerts its action on the cardiovascular system both directly and indirectly. Blood
pressure, a very vital player in the domain of cardiovascular diseases, is in turn itself affected by increased
alcohol consumption. Blood pressure gets increased on regular consumption of alcohol in a manner which is
dose-dependent, which in turn increases the risk of hypertension and eventually leads to various
cardiovascular complications. How exactly alcohol causes hypertension is still unclear with many
pathophysiological theories out there. Atrial fibrillation, one of the most common causes of arrhythmia, is
associated with the high-volume chronic intake of alcohol and above 14 g alcohol/day, the relative risk
dramatically increases by 10% for each extra standard drink (14 g ethanol) [9].
Cerebrovascular accidents are increased to a great extent at almost all levels of alcohol intake [10]. Alcohol
intake leads to both acute (depresses the cardiac function and also alters the blood flow of the involved
region) and chronic cardiovascular manifestations [11]. Alcohol abuse along with other associated factors is
one of the leading causes of secondary cardiomyopathy [12]. Cardiac arrhythmias get precipitated by alcohol
consumption, be it acute or chronic. Heavy alcohol drinking is shown to impact the cardiovascular system in
many ways, one of the most important among them being rebound hypertension [13]. Apart from congenital
disorders of the cardiovascular system, it indeed is a very well-evident fact, which could be understood from
the history of most of the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders, that they used to consume a lot
of alcohol for many years.
Impact of alcohol on the digestive system
Chronic alcoholism is found to have a very strong relationship with both acute pancreatitis and chronic
pancreatitis. Chronic alcohol intake impairs the repair ability of the structures of the exocrine pancreas,
thereby leading to pancreatic dysfunctioning [14]. Most of the patients diagnosed with pancreatitis have a
strong history of chronic intake of alcohol. Liver diseases related to alcohol intake are known to humankind
from the very beginning and probably are one of the oldest known forms of injury to the liver [15]. In liver
diseases linked with alcohol, liver cirrhosis is a major concern. Statistics show that liver cirrhosis is one of
the top 10 causes of death worldwide and this in itself indicates the severity of the same [16]. The changing
lifestyle and also many people turning to prolonged alcohol intake for many years are contributing to the
increased number of liver cirrhosis patients in the modern world. In liver cirrhosis patients, there occurs an
increased severity of fibrosis due to the loss of parenchyma and fibrous scar proliferation [17]. Alcoholic liver
disease (ALD) is an umbrella term which incorporates a wide range of injuries of the liver, spanning from
simple steatosis to cirrhosis, and this also includes alcohol-related fatty liver disease (AFLD) and also
alcoholic hepatitis [18]. Advancements in the diagnostic modalities have helped to diagnose ALD at an early
phase and there is no doubt that newer and better investigations that have helped to detect more cases have
led to a surge in the number of ALD patients on whole. Alcohol intake has a prominently bigger impact on
the mortality of liver cirrhosis when compared with the morbidity [19]. A systemic review and meta-analysis
suggests that women might be at a higher risk as far as developing liver cirrhosis is concerned even with
little consumption of alcohol, as compared to men [20].
Impact of alcohol on the causation of cancer
Alcohol has much to do with cancers too and continuous research studies are conducted in order to find out
the relationship between the two in detail. In a meta-analysis, it was found that women consuming alcohol
had a later menopause onset, which is found to be associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk and
also all-cause mortality, but unfortunately, the happiness of this advantage gets compromised by the ironic
fact that it has an increased risk of cancer (including ovarian and breast cancers) [21,22]. Large cohort
studies, many meta-analyses, experimental research studies, etc are suggestive of the fact that the chronic
intake of alcohol clearly increases colon and gastric cancer risk [23]. A causal association is also found
between alcohol intake and cancers of the rectum, colon, liver, oesophagus, larynx, pharynx and oral cavity
[24]. There are various theories put forward so as to understand the role of the consumption of alcohol in the
development of cancer; there is suspicion that the rise in the number of alcohol users worldwide may be one
of the reasons why the number of cancer patients is increasing at a global level. Chronic intake of alcohol
may promote the genesis of cancer in many ways, some of the most notable ones being acetaldehyde (weak
mutagen and carcinogen) production, cytochrome P450 2E1 induction associated oxidative stress, S-
adenosylmethionine depletion/ which leads to global DNA hypomethylation induction, iron induction
associated oxidative stress, retinoic acid metabolism impairment, etc [25].
Impact of alcohol on other systems
Apart from the systemic manifestations which do affect a particular system of the body, there are various
disorders in which alcohol indirectly provides its crucial contribution. It is a common finding that one could

"Effects of Alcohol Consumption on Various Systems of the Human BodyA Systematic Review.pdf,page:4","perceive that alcohol is most of the time in the list of risk factors for various diseases. Alcohol has been
found to adversely affect our immune system and the matter of concern as far as this issue is concerned is
that immune responses are influenced by even moderate amounts of alcohol intake [26]. Alcohol affects
innate immunity and also interferes with almost all the various aspects of the adaptive immune response.
Alcohol is a key player in impairing anti-inflammatory cytokines and also promotes proinflammatory
immune responses. The gastrointestinal biome is severely manipulated by the use of alcohol over a long

Alcohol and its metabolites are found to promote inflammation in the intestines and they do so through
varied pathways [28]. Alcohol being a teratogen is documented to cause abnormalities of the brain, limbs, etc

TABLE 1: Implications from various studies (sytemic review, meta-analysis, cohort study,
prospective study, etc) regarding effects of alcohol consumption on the human body
Conclusions
Alcohol seldom leaves any system untouched as far as leaving its impression is concerned, spanning from
single tissue involvement to complex organ system manifestations. Almost all the major organs that make
up a human’s physiological being are dramatically affected by the overconsumption of alcohol. There is an
enormous overall economic cost that is paid for alcohol abuse all over the world.

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:4","Executive Summary
This review of reviews relating to the impact of alcohol consumption on young people was
undertaken between May and October 2008 by a research team based at the Institute of
Health and Society at Newcastle University. The work was commissioned by the Department
for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) - Tender No: eor/sbu/2008/007.
Aims and Objectives
The aim of the study was to undertake a systematic review of the published review literature
and summarise the evidence on the harms and benefits of alcohol consumption for children
and young people. In this process we assessed the quality of the evidence in this field and its
relevance to a UK population. We also identified gaps in the research which need to be
addressed.
Methods and Limitations
After a systematic search of the published evidence, 162 eligible reviews were found. These
reviews were graded in terms of methodological quality and the strength of the conclusions
that could be drawn from them. In the final narrative, 102 reviews were summarised to
consider the impact of drinking on young people. The unused reviews consisted of duplicate
material, older reviews and/or those of poorer methodological quality. This report takes the
form of a narrative summary of the reviews’ findings. For ease of reading, references are
presented using the Vancouver system in which each one is represented in the text by a
unique number and then all are ordered numerically in a reference list at the end of the
report.
The evidence-base included many older reviews and there was a preponderance of research
from the USA. In addition, the literature focused on adolescents and older teenagers but
there was little information about prepubescent children. As a result, this body of work has
limited generalisability to contemporary drinking by young people in England, particularly in
younger children. Moreover, many of the reviews were methodologically weak and so it is not
possible to discount bias from their findings. Lastly, most of the reviews were based on
cross-sectional research which is unable to determine a causal link between risk factors and
alcohol misuse, or indeed, between alcohol misuse and specific health or social
consequences.
It is not clear whether current adult guidance on low risk drinking is pertinent to young people
or if specific recommendations are required for individuals who are in the midst of ongoing
physiological and emotional development. The review has confirmed that there is a lack of
good review evidence available about the impact of drinking on children and young people.
However, an absence of evidence in this field does not mean that there is evidence of no
impact of alcohol on such individuals. Despite the methodological weakness of research in
this field, there is a large body of evidence which reports consistent trends between alcohol
use and a range of adverse effects. This convergence allows us to draw credible conclusions
about the impact of drinking on young people (particularly around or following puberty).
Below we have summarised the review evidence on risks and protective factors that
influence alcohol misuse by young people and also the possible adverse or beneficial
consequences associated with children and young people drinking alcohol. We have noted
areas where there were gaps or deficiencies in the evidence base.
2"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:5","I. Risks Associated with Alcohol Misuse in Children and Young People
The evidence suggests that there are a number of risk factors associated with alcohol
misuse by children and young people. These include:
• a genetic predisposition (generational transmission)
• physical and sexual abuse in childhood, which may lead to later drinking behaviour
• early exposure to drinking alcohol, which may increase the risk of problematic
drinking in adolescence
• behavioural patterns of alcohol consumption of parents, grandparents and siblings
• family history of alcohol problems
• early behaviour problems in children, which may place them at especially high risk of
alcohol problems, particularly if there is a family history of alcohol problems
• antisocial behaviour and inter-personal problems in pre-adolescent children, which
may be predictive of substance use disorders
• children and young people who are sensation-seeking or have impulsive personality
types may drink in large quantities
• heavy and binge drinking by young people can be a mechanism for coping with stress
or anxiety
• there may be gender differences between mothers and fathers in terms of their
influence on the behaviour of sons and daughters
• involvement in drinking games can lead to very high levels of alcohol consumption
• Mechanisms to protect children and young people, such as excessive criticism of
their drinking behaviour, may not be protective but harmful.
• Young people should be advised and supported to rely less on alcohol to facilitate
social integration with their peers and to develop other more constructive peer group
relationships.
II Protective Factors that Inhibit Alcohol Misuse in Children and Young People
Protective factors are very important as they can ameliorate risk factors. Our examination of
the evidence about protective factors has shown that:
• the location of a young person’s first drink may be important to future alcohol misuse,
children who first use alcohol in a home environment and learn about its effects from
parents are less likely to misuse alcohol than those who begin drinking outside the
home and experiment with peers
• delaying the time of a young person’s first drink may reduce the risk of harmful
drinking.
3"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:6","• having adults who retain good relationships with a young person, characterised by
appropriate levels of support and control, is likely to be protective
• controlled alcohol use is not in itself predictive of negative outcomes
• religious affiliation, especially attendance at religious services, may have a protective
effect against alcohol consumption
• Key factors that seem to buffer the adverse effects of alcohol consumption in children
and young people include informed and supportive parental guidance about alcohol
and a delay in the age of initiation into drinking.
III Adverse Consequences of Drinking Alcohol for Children and Young People
We are able to say with confidence that there are potentially adverse consequences for
children and young people who misuse alcohol. The evidence suggests that:
• adolescents who misuse alcohol are more likely to suffer from side effects including
appetite changes, weight loss, eczema, headaches and sleep disturbance
• the most common impacts of alcohol intoxication are vomiting and coma
• young people are not immune to the chronic diseases and conditions associated with
excess alcohol consumption in adults, and deaths from liver disease are now
occurring at younger ages
• adolescents and young people who drink and drive, or allow themselves to be carried
by a drink driver, are more likely to be involved in a car accident
• adolescents and young people who drink alcohol are more likely to sustain an injury,
often as a result of an assault
• alcohol abuse in adolescence, during a developmentally sensitive period, poses a
particular danger to the emerging brain faculties of executive functioning and long
term memory
• adolescents are likely to be more vulnerable than adults to both subtle brain damage
and long lasting cognitive deficits following alcohol exposure
• alcohol may increase feelings of depression
• stress / anxiety based drinking is associated with long-term and more severe negative
outcomes
• there is a relationship between adolescent alcohol use and mental health problems,
so it is important that all young people with alcohol problems should have a mental
health assessment
• alcohol consumption during an evening may affect a child’s performance at school on
the following day, since it takes time to metabolize alcohol and this process varies
depending on the dose of alcohol that was consumed and differing metabolic capacity
• the evidence shows that there are associations between alcohol consumption and
subsequent behaviour with peers and friends. Indeed, excessive alcohol use can be
4"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:7","detrimental to a young person being able to maintain friendships, particularly if the
consumption levels are higher than among the peer group generally.
Moreover, there is evidence that
• young people of college age who use alcohol are more likely than their abstaining
peers to use cannabis
• alcohol consumption can have a detrimental effect on young people’s short term
educational performance
• students are more likely to miss classes because of drinking
• alcohol consumption by young people, particularly students, is more likely to make
them vulnerable to being the victims of crime
• alcohol may make some young people more likely to display aggressive behaviour,
although it is likely that other factors such as their personality and family life will play
a role
In relation to sexual health and behaviour, the evidence confirms that alcohol consumption is
associated with:
• not using a condom during a young person’s first sexual encounter
• an increased likelihood of having sex and at a younger age
• unprotected sex
• teenage pregnancy
• the likelihood of contracting sexually transmitted diseases
IV Positive Consequences of Children and Young People Drinking Alcohol
While the negative consequences of alcohol misuse are considerable and must be taken
seriously, there is evidence of some positive impacts associated with young people being
able to drink sensibly. For example, the evidence shows that:
• some young people may benefit by having increased confidence when communicating
with members of the opposite sex

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:8","Concluding remarks
There are many adverse consequences of drinking alcohol during childhood and
adolescence which would seem to outweigh the modest number of positive impacts. Overall,
it seems that delaying the age of alcohol initiation and limiting the amount drunk by young
people is likely to enhance their health and well-being.
The review literature has significant evidence gaps in the area of alcohol use by, and its
consequences in, children and young people. A key gap is the lack of information about the
precise amounts of alcohol that lead to adverse consequences. Also the majority of the
evidence in this field relates to older youth (adolescents and college/university students).
There is a real need for more research relating to younger children, since it is clear that
alcohol drinking can and does occur prior to puberty in some UK children.
This study has been constrained by the material that is currently available in published
reviews. More progress is likely to be made by a systematic review of primary data in this
field. However, there is also a clear need for more well-designed prospective studies in UK
populations which measure alcohol use with precision and which characterise the range of
possible adverse effects of drinking. There is also a requirement, in population studies, for
multivariate analysis of key predictor variables in such a way that can control for possible
confounding factors. Lastly, there is a need for longitudinal studies that follow-up younger
people who drink to identify impacts over the longer term.

1.1 Background
In England, the proportion of young people aged between 11-15 who reported having drunk
alcohol decreased from 62% to 54%, between 1988 and 2007. However, the amount
consumed by the young people who drink increased from 6.4 units per week in 1994 to 12.7
units per week in 2007 [1]. The largest increase was seen in 14 year olds who increased
their alcohol consumption from 6.1 to 9.9 units per week over this period. Furthermore, this
increase was not gender specific. For both boys and girls there was a substantial increase in
the amount of alcohol consumed [1]. Moreover, one in four young people aged 14 reported
consuming over 10 units of alcohol on their last drinking occasion; this level of consumption
increased to one in three by the age of 15 [2]. In 2001 it was reported that young people’s
drinking tends to be confined to fewer days than adults, and in particular at weekends [2].
Thus young people (aged 11-15), who drink, tend to do less frequently but at a higher
intensity than adults.
In young people (aged 16-24), the latest NHS Information Statistics on Alcohol (2008)
reported that 26% of males and 24% of females drink over the recommended weekly limits
for low risk drinking in adults, which are 21 units for men and 14 units for women. Moreover it
is shown that 9% of young males and 6% of young females drank over 50 units per week
which is indicative of high risk drinking in adults [3]. It is not clear whether current adult
guidance on low risk drinking is pertinent to young people or if specific recommendations are
required for individuals who are in the midst of ongoing physiological and emotional
development.
During the last 30 years the number of deaths due to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis has
risen steadily in England [4] and this trend is particularly marked in the 25-34 year group with
the number rising from 16 in 1970 to 68 in 2000 for men and from 7 in 1970 to 60 in 2000 for
women [4]. The majority of liver disease in this country is due to heavy drinking [5].
However, the most significant physical health risks associated with alcohol consumption in
young people at the present moment are those relating to accidents and injuries. The
ESPAD study [6] reported that 13% of all 15-16 year olds had been involved in an accident
or had an injury as a result of drinking [6].
In Scotland, it has been reported that on a daily basis, 15 children under the age of 17 attend
Emergency Departments, intoxicated and in need of medical assistance or treatment [7].
Indeed an audit of 21 emergency departments over a 6 week period showed that 648
children and young people under the age of 17 required medical treatment; 15 of these
cases were below the age of 12 and one was as young as 8 years old. On average these
young people had consumed 13 units of alcohol within the 24 hours leading up to their
attendance [7]. If this number were to be extrapolated for England it would give an estimate
of around 1245 young people per week requiring medical assistance or treatment in England
(64,750 per year).
In England some 35,472 young people aged 16-24 were admitted to hospital in 2005 with
alcohol-related conditions [8]. The largest proportion (19,533) were male and the figures
increased with increasing age [8]. Whilst it is clear from these figures that excessive drinking
by young people is a significant concern in the UK, it is not clear what impact this alcohol
misuse has on their health and well-being beyond the immediate hospital episode.
7"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:10","Heavy drinking by young people is more pronounced in areas with high social deprivation.
The highest levels of alcohol consumption are reported by young people in the North-East of
England and Yorkshire and Humberside where they are 1.5 times more likely to have drunk
alcohol during the last week than young people living in the rest of England [1]. In 2008, a
survey of 1,250 young people living in deprived communities in Britain found that over a third
did not know what a unit of alcohol was and did not understand the term binge drinking. Of
these young people, 39% drank up to 20 units per week and 15% drank over 20 units per
week [9]. Thus the adverse effects of social deprivation on young people may be
compounded by possible health and social problems related to heavy drinking.
In a survey of school children aged 15 and 16 from the North West of England, participants
reported that being aged 16, receiving a greater amount of income per week and not having
a hobby or being a member of a club or sports team was associated with higher levels of
alcohol [10]. In addition, a higher percentage of girls reported drinking in public places whilst
a higher percentage of binge drinkers were male [10]. The 2005/2006 Health Behaviour in
School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey (on patterns of health among young people in 41
countries and regions across Europe and North America) provides an international
comparison [11]. Notably, findings suggest that young people in the UK have some of the
highest rates of drunkenness internationally. England had the highest proportion of girls
(24%) that reported that they had first been drunk at the age of 13 or younger. Rates for
English boys were also high 23% reported they had been drunk at age 13 or younger [11].
Thus there are clear grounds for concern about alcohol consumption in young people in
England and it seems that many aspects of young people’s drinking may be situational or
culturally determined. Moreover, whilst there is some evidence that parents’ attitudes about
alcohol may shape their children’s views (particularly in younger children) about drinking [12],
it seems that other direct mechanisms such as access to pocket money and involvement in
diversionary activities (or not) may also determine if, when and how much their children
drink. However, it is currently not clear to parents what risks arise for their children from early
exposure to, or different levels of, alcohol consumption. Many parents may feel that early
introduction to alcohol by them is preferable to its use in unsupervised experimentation.
However, there is currently insufficient information to base such decisions on.
In adults there are some health and social benefits associated with alcohol consumption.
However, the health benefits are linked to cardio-protective effects of low to moderate
consumption of alcohol which have generally been identified in older adults, that is men aged
over 40 and post-menopausal women [13, 14]. The positive social effects of drinking are well
known to the majority of the adult population that chooses to drink alcohol, although these
effects are rarely studied in research terms. In young people, it is not clear whether there is
any health benefits associated with drinking in early life. It is likely that young people will
perceive positive social effects of drinking [15]. However, it is possible that these may be
tempered by adverse consequences that may arise from drinking at an age before alcohol is
legal.
On the basis of current epidemiological evidence on adverse consequences of drinking,
particularly in young people who become intoxicated, the alcohol harm reduction strategy for
England has highlighted that underage drinking is a major public health priority [16] and
outlined three objectives for tackling it:
1. Delaying the onset of regular drinking, primarily by changing the attitudes of 11-15
year olds and their parents about alcohol.
2. Reducing harm to young people who have already started to drink.
3. Creating a culture in which young people feel they can have fun without needing to
drink.
8"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:11","Recent NICE guidelines on alcohol interventions in schools [17] and the Government’s
recent Youth Alcohol Action Plan also set out clear priorities concerning alcohol and young
people under the age of 18. One of the actions in the Action Plan is to issue advice to
parents about young people and alcohol, which will include guidelines for low risk drinking
[18]. This ‘guidance will also offer wider information on the health and social impacts of
drinking at young ages, sources of help and support for parents including evidence-based
approaches for them to use with their children’ (page 18) [18]. Furthermore, the 2007 Chief
Medical Officers Report recognised that young people's health is the key to the nation’s
future. He identified six priority risk-taking areas of which one was alcohol and drugs [19].
In order to inform the proposed guidelines on alcohol and young people, this review was
commissioned to identify published evidence on both the harms and benefits of drinking in
early life. Given that there was a limited time-frame available for the work, the commissioning
brief asked for a focus on existing reviews in this field. The purpose of this work was to
provide an assessment of this evidence to an expert group of clinicians/researchers
convened by the Department for Children, Families and Schools to enable them to make
recommendations to parents about their children’s drinking.
The aim of the study were to:
• produce a thorough review of the most up-to-date, robust and reliable evidence on the
harms and benefits of alcohol consumption for children and young people;
• undertake a systematic search of existing reviews and weigh-up the quality of the
evidence base;
• communicate and discuss the findings with the expert panel on alcohol and young
people;
• support the Department in accurately and appropriately interpreting and using the
evidence;
• ensure the guidance for parents is based on a firm evidence base; and
• identify evidence gaps that longer term research needs to address.
1.2 Operationalising harms and benefits of alcohol in young people
The harms and benefits of drinking can be considered not only in terms of what happens to
young people after they have consumed alcohol but also in terms of risks and protective (or
resilience) factors that influence this behaviour. The issue of risk and protective factors
influencing substance use in young people has been discussed in detailed elsewhere [20]. In
essence, risk factors are personal attributes or situational and/or environmental contexts that
increase the likelihood of engaging in a behaviour (or the extent to which they engage in this
behaviour) which adversely affects an individual. Conversely, protective factors are personal
attributes or situational and/or environmental contexts that buffer, reduce or inhibit the
behaviour in question. In this review we consider both possible influences leading to drinking
and consequences resulting from alcohol consumption in young people (see Figure 1).

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:13","2. Methods
Given the existence of several reviews examining the social and/or medical impact of alcohol
on young people, this study comprises a synthesis of published reviews (a review of reviews)
to establish an up-to-date and robust picture of the available and authoritative evidence in
this field. Standard systematic reviewing methods were tailored to utilise existing reviews
rather than primary research [21].
2.1 Criteria for including studies in the review
Study design
The term “review” can be used to describe a wide range of work, from an expert commentary
on a topic, a narrative description of several papers in a field or a full systematic review. The
latter involves: a pre-specified question and protocol; a defined search strategy; clear
inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies; a clear quality assessment of included studies
and, if appropriate, meta-analysis or pooling of data across similar research studies in a field.
It is generally accepted that a systematic review is the most likely form of review to minimise
bias, as it uses a transparent approach that attempts to access all the relevant information of
a topic. Thus we developed a checklist of methodological criteria to assess the quality of the
reviews that were identified by our own systematic review process.
Participants
As 5 is the age when children can legally drink alcohol in the home, the main focus of the
review was on children aged 5-19 years [22], but young adults aged 20-25 years were also
included. We were directed not to include foetal exposure to alcohol as part of this work.
Behaviour
Reviews were considered if they included studies on the consumption of alcohol and its
impact on the health of the drinker and / or his / her family, friends or associates. We were
interested in establishing both adverse and possible beneficial impacts of drinking. In
addition, we were interested in reviews which reported the assessment of any differences in
risks associated with different patterns and levels of consumption.
Setting
Any setting was acceptable for inclusion.
Outcome
Outcomes of interest included direct harms to physical, social or mental health of the drinking
individual (e.g. cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, depression, social); indirect harms to the
health of the drinking individual (e.g. injuries from an increase in risky behaviour); social
harms to the drinking individual or their associates (such as aggression within the family,
criminality and educational effects); or predictors of harm. Also of interest were social and
psychological benefits, and protective factors that might increase resilience for the drinking
individual in terms of alcohol. Potential confounders, such as behavioural or emotional
disorders that may have preceded alcohol use, were noted.
1 1"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:14","Exclusions
We excluded reviews which focused on interventions which aimed to delay the onset of
drinking or reduce alcohol consumption in young people who drank. Due to limitations of
time and resources, non-English language papers were also excluded.
2.2 Search strategy for identification of studies
Databases
Since the focus of the search was reviews, sources relating to unpublished literature (such
as conference proceedings and other grey literature) were not employed. The Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
Effectiveness (DARE) were also not searched, since by definition their contents are reviews
of interventions, which were excluded from the scope of this review. The following electronic
databases were searched for relevant reviews:

2.3 Review strategy
Assessment for inclusion
Titles, citations and abstracts were downloaded into Endnote X libraries for processing.
Nearly 6,000 titles and abstracts of potentially relevant reviews were independently
examined in Endnote by two reviewers on the team to exclude references which clearly did
not meet the inclusion criteria. Full text papers of 700 reviews were independently checked
for inclusion by two reviewers. The 700 reviews were scrutinised to ensure that they were
reviews and that they were relevant to the study. Differences in opinion between the two
reviewers were resolved by discussion, leaving 156 eligible reviews. A further 6 reviews that
had not been found within the searches were included. These 6 reviews were identified
through checking our own files, reference lists and word of mouth. Of the 162 papers that
were identified, 102 were used in the final report. The 62 that were not used included
evidence that had been updated within the 102 that was used.

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:17","3. Findings
One hundred and sixty two reviews were found that met the criteria. Of these 102 were used
in the report.
The evidence-base included many older reviews and there was a preponderance of research
from the USA (appendix 6). Thus this work has limited generalisability to contemporary
drinking by young people in England. Many of the reviews were methodologically weak and
so it is not possible to discount bias from their findings (table 1). Lastly, most of the reviews
were based on cross-sectional research work which is unable to determine a causal link
between risk factors and alcohol misuse or indeed alcohol misuse and specific health or
social consequences.
Thus there is a lack of good review evidence about the impact of drinking on young people.
However, an absence of evidence in this field does not mean there is evidence of no impact.
Despite the methodological weakness of work in this field, there is a large body of evidence
which reports consistent trends between alcohol use and a range of adverse effects. This
convergence allows us to draw reasonable conclusions about the impact of drinking on
young people.

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:18","4. Findings - Health
4.1 Acute and chronic health problems
As alcohol-related diseases such as liver cirrhosis, cancers and heart disease take time to
develop; chronic effects resulting directly from alcohol misuse are rarely seen among young
people. Thus it is the shorter-term acute effects of alcohol consumption that are more evident
in this population. In particular, acute intoxication can occur rapidly and by surprise in
children and young people which is probably due to a combination of physiological factors
(e.g. limited ability to metabolise alcohol and lower body weight) and socio-cultural reasons
(including a lack of experience of the effects of alcohol and drinking in unsupervised
contexts). The most common impacts of alcohol intoxication are vomiting (~ 60% of children
hospitalized for alcohol use) and coma, which in cold environments can result in fatal
hypothermia [24].
Acute health problems
Newburn and Shiner (2001) report that it is highly likely that children’s inexperience of the
effects of alcohol intoxication, and the fact that they are more likely to consume alcohol in
‘risky’ environments brings with it an increased risk of accidents and injuries leading to the
need for hospitalisation [2]. Alcohol use may be a significant contributor to injury in
adolescence and may play a role in more than 50% of traumatic brain injuries in adolescents
[25]. Alcohol use was also linked to 80% of adolescent deaths from homicides, suicides and
unintentional injuries [26] and to an increased risk of illness and death at an early age,
predominantly caused by suicide and violent accidents [27]. Irwin and Millstein (1986)
reported that adolescents who were involved in drowning, falls and burns had a greater
frequency of blood alcohol levels over 0.10% [28]. It should be noted that reviews in this area
are often unclear as to whether hospital presentations relate to acute alcohol effects such as
alcohol poisoning, to the consequences of drinking, such as injury or to chronic conditions
although the latter are rare in young people [29].
Table 2 shows alcohol attributable fractions (AAFs) for a range of health-relevant conditions,
broken down by age and sex; these figures are based on global data [30]. The numbers
show the proportion of deaths in the respective injury category attributable to alcohol based
on population-weighted averages of the regional estimates (only ages 0-29 are shown
below). The highest fractions are in the 15-29 year old group and occur in males dying from
motor vehicle accidents, poisonings and other unintentional injuries [30].

In the US alcohol-related road accidents are the greatest cause of death and injury amongst
undergraduate students in the US [31]. Sindelar et al. (2004) reported that 13-19% of all
adolescents involved in a car accidents tested positive for alcohol [29]. The highest rates of
drink driving mortality, arrests for drunkenness and drink driving were in the 18-24 year old
population [32].
With regard to accidental injury other than those caused by road accidents, adolescents and
young people of college age are more likely to be injured than their abstaining peers.
Significantly, the cause of injury was frequently assault [29].
Thunstrom (1988) identified a particularly high risk group of young people comprising about
20% of young people admitted to hospital for alcohol intoxication. This high risk group
consisted of mostly boys from lower socio-economic status groups, who before the acute
episode of drunkenness had shown signs of ‘psychiatric insufficiency’, or extreme shyness
and a retiring disposition, or restlessness, impulsiveness and aggressive behaviour [27].
Such individuals often had difficulties in social adjustment, including problems at school.
These children had also been brought up in homes characterized by insecurity, broken
families with only one parent (who was often an ‘exhausted’ mother), with an alcoholic or a
mentally disturbed parent or in a home marked by disorganization with few good emotional
relations. It was also reported that the children had been using alcohol before the acute
episode (no information given on use). They were often apprehended on a week day and
neither they themselves nor their parents showed notable anxiety reaction with regard to the
admission to hospital. This review concluded that in this ‘high risk’ group of children the
acute episode of alcohol intoxication was a warning signal for future problems. This
compares to a low-risk group (comprising about 50-55%) of cases that would be seen as
healthy children from a psychiatric point of view, from secure homes that have shown no
previous signs of social maladjustment. They are generally admitted to hospital on a Friday
or Saturday night and both they themselves and their parents show anxiety reactions in
connection with the event [27].
1 7"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:20","Chronic health problems
It is widely known that prolonged alcohol abuse has numerous longer-term harmful health
effects and adolescents are not immune to these risks. Zeigler et al. (2005) reported a
comprehensive exploration of the deleterious physiological effect of drinking at a young age
[25]. In common with earlier work, these authors found that while chronic diseases are
relatively uncommon in adolescents who misuse alcohol, these individuals experience
significantly more medical symptoms than those who don’t misuse alcohol, including appetite
changes, weight loss, eczema, headaches, and sleep disturbance [25].
In summary, the current review found very little evidence relating to liver disease in young
people. Saunders and Bailey (1993) reported that the overwhelming majority of deaths from
liver disease occur in the over 21’s [33]. Moreover, Clark et al. (2002) reported that serum
liver enzymes were typically only modestly elevated in adolescents with alcohol problems
[34]. However, Zeigler et al. (2005) later found that serum enzymatic markers of liver damage
were elevated in alcohol-abusing adolescents [25]. Whilst there is great inter-individual
variability in susceptibility to alcohol-related liver disease, two notable risk factors are the
dose of alcohol consumed [35] and the length of time of heavy drinking [36]. Deaths from
alcoholic hepatitis or decompensated cirrhosis are rare in patients under 25, but when these
deaths do occur, they are as a result of several years of heavy drinking [37]. Thus although
there is no direct evidence that adolescent livers are more susceptible to alcohol than adult
livers, the consequences of heavy drinking in adolescence are now being seen in early
adulthood with devastating consequences.
Levels of evidence
Of the 10 reviews used in this section, 1 was categorised as 1+ (A); 5 as 2- (C) and 4 as
level 3 (D). Although methodologically one review was good quality with a low risk of bias,
the majority of the evidence was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk of
confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal or non-analytical
studies.
4.2 Genetics
Relatively little research on the genetics of alcoholism has focused specifically on young
people [38]. This may be due to their short drinking histories so that they generally do not
show signs of severe alcohol dependence, however Boyd et al. (2005) suggested that
‘genetic predisposition … may mediate relationships between developmental transitions’
(such as starting college) and alcohol use [31]. For instance, membership of fraternities and
sororities in US colleges is associated with higher rates of drinking [31]. However, those
already predisposed to drinking may choose such environments [31].
Much of what is known about alcohol and genetics has been extrapolated from studies of
adult alcohol use [38]. For instance, Hawkins et al. (1992) considered genetic influences
using adoption studies [39]. The literature available at the time showed that among adopted
children, 18-27% of the sons of alcoholic biological parents developed alcohol problems even
when raised by adoptive parents, compared to 6% of the sons of non-alcoholic biological
parents [39].
Studies have shown that that lifetime risk of alcoholism is apportioned roughly equally
between environmental and genetic factors and these factor interact substantially [40] [41].
However, Rose (1998) reported that twin studies have shown the age of initiation (to drinking
and to drinking to intoxication) and abstinence to be influenced by cultural or shared
environmental (including parental abstinence) and not genetic factors [42]. However,
identical twins compared to non-identical twins were more similar in drinking frequency and
1 8"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:21","these differences between genetically identical and non-identical twins increased with
experience of alcohol, an environment facilitative of alcohol use allows genetic
predispositions to emerge. However, Rutter (2007) reported a ‘substantial shared genetic
liability between the age at which an individual started drinking and the later development of
alcoholism’ so that, according to this view, although there is likely to be some shared
environmental contribution, age at initiation of drinking is predominantly a marker of
predisposition rather than a cause of alcohol problems [38]. Similarly, a study of Korean
children adopted by Caucasian US parents measured the gene for acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase gene which is in two forms; one allele common in East Asians is associated
with an unpleasant flushing experience with alcohol. Those with the variant linked to the
flushing response have low rates of alcoholism. Adoptees with the variant, compared to
those without, showed low rates of alcoholism but there were no between-group differences
in rates of antisocial behaviour and drug abuse. This suggested that “the association (of early
alcohol misuse, antisocial behaviour and drug misuse) was derived from a shared general
liability for problem behaviour and not from the causal effect of early drinking” [38].
Furthermore, there was no effect of adoptive parental alcoholism on adolescent drinking; the
major source of a familial environmental effect was sibling and not parental drinking [38].
Rose (1998) also reported that ‘individual differences in … risk relevant behaviours (relevant
to emerging alcohol problems in late adolescence) are familial and moderately heritable’.
Citing data from longitudinal studies, he comments that ‘as early as kindergarten and
elementary school, behavioural ratings by teachers and classmates can help distinguish
children who are more likely to abuse alcohol by middle to late adolescence’. In a Swedish
longitudinal study behavioural dimensions derived from these ratings were termed ‘high
novelty seeking and ‘low harm avoidance’. Data revealed that ‘Boys with these two childhood
behavioural dimensions had a 20 fold higher risk of alcoholism’. Also, boys of alcoholic
fathers were more persistently oppositional and hyperactive than matched controls. Detailed
analysis suggested that ‘A boy’s alcoholism risk lies in his (disruptive) behavioural
dispositions (which are heritable) and not in father’s alcohol use status’. A New Zealand
multivariate study showed that the highest risk (of progression from initial… alcohol use to
early alcoholism) was ‘among boys from disadvantaged homes who showed early onset
conduct problems’. On the basis of similar findings from New Zealand and the US he
concluded that, ‘… behavioural precursors of alcoholism are evident to trained observers in
children as young as three and to teachers and classmates at the time of school entry’ [42].
Twin studies have shown that high risk children (of parents with alcoholism) exhibit more
aggression and non-compliance (girls) and hyperactivity / impulsivity (boys) than control
children. High risk twins are more likely to report their peers as smokers and experimenters
with drugs and alcohol. These behaviours show stronger concordance in identical compared
to non-identical twins and are regarded as significantly heritable.
Data from adoption studies suggest that the co-occurrence of alcohol misuse and depression
requires experience of environmental adversity, such as being the non-adopted child of
alcohol misusing parents or exposure to ‘adoptive parent risk factors’ [38].

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:22","4.3 Effect on brain development
Adolescence is a period of significant brain maturation [43]. In the second decade, brain
functioning is enhanced by active myelination (where nerve fibres acquire a complex
lipoprotein sheath) and the removal of redundant synaptic connections in the prefrontal
cortex and limbic system [44]. The prefrontal cortex, which decreases in volume as it
matures, governs such functions as: attention to tasks; integration of information from the
different senses; impulse control; voluntary motor behaviour; planning, problem solving,
abstract thinking, reasoning and judgement [25, 44]. Conversely, the limbic system structures
(hippocampus, amygdala and septal areas) in the medial temporal lobes increase in volume.
The hippocampus has a particularly important role in encoding long term memory and
damage to these neurons can disrupt individual’s ability to form new memories for facts and
events [25]. As well as these morphological changes, adolescence brings significant
neurochemical changes in brain synapses. Simply put, changes in brain volume affect the
number of receptors that respond to circulating neurotransmitters such as Glutamate, an
excitatory neurotransmitter which influences the process of learning and memory. A major
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain is Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is
potentiated by alcohol and which inhibits the action of glutamate. Hence increased levels of
GABA contribute to depressant effects on cognition.
These structural and functional changes in the young brain continue until about 20 years of
age [25, 43]. Because the adolescent brain is undergoing these dynamic changes, it is likely
to be more susceptible to damage due to adverse environmental influences than the
relatively stable adult brain [25, 45]. Since alcohol is both miscible with water and lipid
soluble, it is readily absorbed from the stomach and intestine, distributed throughout the body
it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier [25]. Indeed the concentration of alcohol in the brain
parallels the concentration in the blood. Under normal circumstances about 98% of ingested
alcohol is metabolised by enzymes in the stomach and liver and eliminated by the kidneys
[25]. The average rate of metabolism is about 30 ml (1 oz) in 3 hours [25]. If alcohol is
consumed at a rate greater than it is eliminated, blood alcohol concentration will rise until
drinking stops.
Adolescents typically have less body mass than adults and have not developed the
physiological or behavioural tolerance to alcohol and its effects [45]. Therefore they do not
need to drink very much to become intoxicated. In addition, they tend to drink heavily and
rapidly because their social, emotional control, thinking and decision making skills are less
developed. This combination of factors may lead to short and mid-term effects on the brain.
In addition, individuals who begin drinking early and continue to drink may experience longer-
term brain effects.
Shorter-term effects
• Alcohol stimulates the release of endorphins giving the subject a sense of well being
which can encourage continued drinking. Increasing intoxication leads to euphoria, loss
of inhibition, reduced coordination, garrulousness and belligerence [45].
• With increasing blood alcohol concentrations subjects experience lethargy, cardio-
respiratory depression.
• With further intake subjects develop stupor and coma that may end in death [25].
Mid-term effects
• Alcohol disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, altering total sleep time [46]. Consolidation of
learnt material takes place in sleep and so this can be adversely affected by persistent
2 0"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:23","drinking. Research suggests that alcohol has a more profound effect on memory and
learning in adolescents than in people who start drinking in later life.
• It has been reported that the fatal dose of alcohol in childhood could be as low as 3
grams/kg in a child compared to 5-8 grams/kg in an adult [24]. In a 30 kg ten year old this
equates to 1.5 bottles of wine and in an adult to 5 - 8 bottles with presumably adolescents
in the middle, depending on weight. The reduction though metabolism of 0.1 g/l/hr or
0.08/kg/hr - in the blood means that if a 75 kg adolescent had a blood level of 1g/kg after
a bottle of wine, it would take ten hours for full elimination. Since there is at least a
temporary effect of alcohol on memory, this young person could still have alcohol
affecting their brain function in the school morning. So potentially there could be a
problem with learning in school the morning after heavy drinking, in addition to the fatigue
associated with the alcohol-related sleep disruption.
• Alcohol is also linked with depression, although it is not possible to determine if
adolescents drink due to depression or if depression occurs as a toxic effect of alcohol
consumption [45]. However, research on alcohol abusers has found significantly fewer
locus coeruleus neurons in the brain stem compared to non alcohol abusers, suggesting
that alcohol may change brain structure and thus trigger a behavioural response [25].
Longer-term effects
• In observational studies of subjects with chronic alcohol use disorders, both left and right
hippocampal volumes were significantly smaller than in non users. Thus long-term
memory may be affected by prolonged drinking [25].
• Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow to various
parts of the brain, alcohol abusers have shown reduced perfusion (blood flow) to the
prefrontal and parietal cortices, particularly in the right hemisphere during tasks of spatial
working memory e.g. remembering location of objects [25, 44, 46]. Also subjects with
alcohol dependence demonstrate diminished spatio-visual and motor speed responses
[25, 44, 46].
• Alcohol also stimulates release of the neurotransmitter Dopamine which activates the
Dopaminergic reward pathway [25]; this can make alcohol addictive, as both short term
and long term exposure reinforces this pathway in the brain.
• Abstinence from alcohol after periods of heavy drinking sensitises N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors causing an influx of calcium ions into neurons as a result of their
increased activity. This process is neurotoxic and causes cell degeneration.
Neurocognitive effects and risks
Adolescents have been found to be less vulnerable than adults to impairment of motor
performance by alcohol and as a result have a tendency to drink much more than normal
adults and achieve much higher blood alcohol concentrations before becoming
incapacitated. Also the sedative effect of alcohol appears to be less profound in adolescents
compared to adults [46]. This combination of maintaining motor function for longer and
experiencing less sedation than adults means that adolescents can have a longer exposure
to environmental risks whilst drinking [45]. For instance, younger drinkers may be more
inclined to drive a car after drinking or feel that they can climb up a wall and maintain their
balance.
2 1"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:24","Does alcohol cause brain changes?
For ethical reasons, it is not possible to conduct prospective research on the subject of
alcohol use and brain effects in children and young people. However, the available
observational evidence suggests that adolescents are likely to be more vulnerable than
adults to both subtle brain damage and long lasting cognitive deficits following significant
alcohol exposure [25].
Cognitive and learning impairments from chronic heavy exposure to alcohol can arise from
the neuro-toxic effects of ethanol on vulnerable hippocampus and limbic structures.
Research findings from animal models and observational human studies have shown that
persistent alcohol abuse can result in a decrease in the overall volume of the hippocampus,
the area responsible for long term learning and memory [25]. Cell volumes have been found
to be consistently smaller in alcohol abusing adolescents and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the
degree of hippocampal damage increases with the number of years of alcohol abuse [25]. In
one observational research study cited by Ziegler et al. (2005) 38 adolescent alcohol abusers
were compared with 69 non alcohol users on neuropsychological tests. The former scored
consistently less well in verbal IQ, spelling and reading tests compared to the latter [25].
However it can not be overemphasised that there is a lack of evidence around this area.
Much of the above work has focused on alcohol abusers rather than individuals with
intermittent or low level use. In addition, the research relates to older adolescents rather than
younger children. Nevertheless, from the research identified by this review, it is clear that
alcohol abuse in adolescence can pose a risk to young people’s brains due to the plasticity of
this organ during an important developmental period.
Levels of evidence

and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal.
2 2"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:25","4.4 Mental health
It has been shown that chronic alcohol consumption amongst adolescents may increase
feelings of depression, because it causes serotonin levels to decrease [47]. Among youths
engaged in substance misuse 60% are said to have some form of co-morbid psychiatric
diagnosis [48]. It is argued that these are primarily youths with other, and “remediable
problems” [48]. Pullen (1993) found that anxiety, depression, low self esteem and lack of
success in attaining life goals were associated with drinking however they also cite a study
by Chen and Lockhart (1989) that found that alcohol is not effective in producing a relaxation
or anxiety / tension reduction effect [49].
Many of the reviews discuss the co-existence of the alcohol use and mental health problems
as opposed to examining the temporal or causal relationship between the two difficulties,
resulting in conclusions which are at times ambiguous. Citing adoption studies that showed
increased levels of antisocial behaviour and substance use disorders in children of alcoholics
who were adopted by non drinking adoptive parents, Wilens and Biederman (1994) reported
that psychopathology ‘aggregates with psychoactive substance use disorders’[50]. Also,
antisocial behaviour and interpersonal problems in preadolescent children predicted
psychoactive substance use disorders (PSUDs). Hawkins et al. (1992) reported that early
and persistent behavioural problems, including evidence for negative mood, withdrawal
responses, temper tantrums and aggression, predicted substance misuse and the transition
from use to dependence upon substances [39].
Clark (2004) reported the increased risk of conduct disorder, ADHD, major depressive and
anxiety disorders in the children of parents with alcohol problems compared to the children of
parents without alcohol problems [51]. Clark (2004) also referred to cross-sectional and
longitudinal data illustrating the close links between mental and alcohol use disorders in
adolescence. He proposed that there is ‘a common diathesis’: this increases risk for
‘psychopathologies that interfere with social functioning’ but also for substance misuse and a
range of risky behaviours including alcohol use disorders [52]. This diathesis appears to be
linked with abnormalities in the myelinisation associated with maturation of frontal cortical
networks [44] and is a potential ‘parsimonious…organising concept’, perhaps best
characterised as ‘psychological dysregulation’ or ‘neurobehavioural disinhibition’. Clark and
Bukstein (1998) similarly suggested that alcohol misuse should be conceptualized as ‘one of
a number of deviant behaviours resulting from common risk factors…’[52].
Karam et al. (2008) suggested a relationship existing between alcohol use and anxiety levels
[53]. However there are methodological concerns in this work, which place these findings
under question. Importantly there was little or no evidence supporting recent public concern
that ADHD (and prescribed medication for this condition) increases vulnerability to alcohol
misuse [39, 54, 55].
Galaif et al. (2007) reported a 100% increase in suicide among 10-14 year olds in the years
1980-1999 and a 14% increase in 15-19 year olds [56]. They argued that major depression
was the most common co-morbidity of completed suicide and that alcohol abuse increased
the risk for depression by a factor of 6 and that there is a reciprocal ‘synergistic’ relationship
between depression and alcohol abuse. There was however no findings regarding the causal
relationship.
Alcohol use has been associated with cases of suicide in juveniles [33]. It has been
estimated that alcohol is likely to cause male adolescents to be 17 times and females three
times more likely to attempt suicide [47]. It is argued that alcoholism, depression and suicidal
behaviour are associated with the same biological factors such as abnormalities in the
serotonergic or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal systems [47]. It is possible that adolescents
who use or abuse alcohol are at a greater risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour because
2 3"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:26","each factor (depression and alcoholism) independently increase the risk of suicidal behaviour
and it is possible that they act in a synergistic fashion [47]. When looking at ethnicity,
Caucasian adolescents were twice as likely as the African American victims to have used
ethanol before committing suicide [47, 57]. Furthermore, mixing alcohol and certain
medications can put adults and young people at risk for certain reactions [58]. Importantly
serious reactions can occur whether they are taken at the same time or not. Informing young
people of this will be particularly important [58].
Childhood sexual and physical abuse contribute significantly to the development of alcohol
problems in females perhaps as a form of self-medication [59, 60], although no relationship
was identified in males with similar traumatic experiences [60].
In summary, this literature as a whole suffers from limitations within the findings resulting in
suggestive rather than confirmatory findings [56]. There is evidence that alcohol misuse and
mental disorders aggregate together. An influential interpretation of the association is that it
occurs because behaviour disorders and risk taking in general including alcohol misuse
share a common genetically influenced ‘diathesis’ or predisposition that has been referred to
as ‘psychological dysregulation’ [51]. It is important that all young people with alcohol
problems should have a mental health assessment.
Levels of evidence
Of the 16 reviews used in this section, 1 review was categorised as 1+ (B); 2 as 2+ (C), 11
as 2- (C), and 2 as level 3 (D). Although methodologically one review was good quality with
a low risk of bias and two as having a moderate probability that the relationship is causal, the
majority of the evidence was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk of
confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal.
4.5 Personality
Young people who drink in great quantities on a regular basis and who experience more
negative consequences as a result of their drinking are more likely to be classified as
impulsive, dominant, tough-minded, extraverted and sensation, pleasure or novelty seeking
individuals [61-63]. Such individuals have also been characterised as showing disinhibition,
deviancy, rebelliousness and less behavioural control as well as being non-conforming,
radical and less committed to conventional values than less regular or lighter drinkers [61]
[62].
However, Brennan et al. (1986) found conflicting evidence concerning the relationship
between heavy alcohol use amongst college students and the presence of anxiety and
neuroticism [61]. These authors concluded that two types of heavy drinkers existed, whose
expectancies related to differing personality types; those seeking out of stimulus- enhancing
effects and those seeking tension-reduction effects. Heavy-drinkers who were more neurotic
were found to be more likely to drink to intoxication [61].
Saltz and Elandt (1986) examined the relationship between anxiety, anger or depression and
the use of alcohol [63] and found that heavy drinkers reported feeling less anxious in
dangerous situations and while interacting with members of the opposite sex. Both impulsive
and sensation-seeking drinking and stress / anxiety-based drinking have been associated
with both increased alcohol consumption and increased negative consequences. There is
some evidence that stress/anxiety based drinking is associated with long-term and more
severe negative outcomes [57]. However, even highly sociable drinking can result in negative
consequences for college students [63].
2 4"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:27","Kuntsche et al. (2006) also linked ‘extraversion and sensation seeking’ and ‘neuroticism and
anxiety’ to drinking motives [64]. The former correlated with enhancement factors and was
most common in boys whilst the latter correlated with coping factors and was most common
in girls. These associations varied across countries but not across different ethnic groups
within the same culture. This review concluded that these two personality types may be
gender-specific and that as drinking motives did not emerge until adolescence this may
account for the increased severity of drinking problems in college populations. Although the
latter is also likely to be influenced by such issues as growing independence in college
students and the increased availability of alcohol in this context. Nevertheless, from a
preventative perspective, it may be useful to focus on extraverted sensation seeking males
who drink for enhancement motives and neurotic anxious females who drink for coping
motives.
Dimensions of personality, such as a tendency toward sensation seeking, may relate not only
to drinking but to the choice of drinking partners and drinking venues. Therefore it is
necessary for future research to try and integrate all these variables and examine the
influence of each of them on behaviour. Several researchers have begun examining
multivariate models of individual differences among college students by taking into account
demographic factors, drinking motives, expectancies and personality factors simultaneously
[61, 65, 66].
Kuntche et al.(2005) refer to the ‘motivational model of alcohol use’ that a motive or reason is
a ‘necessary condition for drinking’ [65]. They describe ‘four categories of drinking motives’.
These include ‘…to enhance positive mood or well-being… to obtain social rewards… to
attenuate negative emotions and to avoid social rejection’. Motives may be conscious or
unconscious [65]. A related concept of alcohol expectancies refers to beliefs about the
cognitive, affective and behavioural effects of alcohol which can be both positive (“drinking
allows me to relax”) and negative (“when I drink, I often say things that I regret later”) [62].
Brennan et al. (1986) examined motives for drinking in college students and identified two
general types of drinking motives: drinking for social purposes and drinking for emotional
escape or coping purposes [61]. In fact five of the eight papers reviewed by Brennan et al.
(1986) discussed alcohol consumption for coping purposes [61]. Conversely, Kuntsche et al.
(2005) reported that the majority of drinkers volunteer social motives (e.g. to make a party
more enjoyable) which were associated with moderate drinking[65]; drinking for coping
purposes was associated with heavy drinking or binge drinking [65].
Burke and Stephens (1999) cite a study by Smith et al. (1995) in which 461 male and female
seventh graders (around 12 years of age) completed questionnaires looking at their alcohol
use and alcohol expectancies and were reassessed at 12 and 24 months. The results
showed that when controlling for pre-existing alcohol use, positive alcohol expectancies was
a significant predictor of both early alcohol initiation and subsequent higher levels of alcohol
use. Low expectancy teenagers either did not begin to drink at all or increased their drinking
only gradually [67]. A similar conclusion was also reached by Baer (2002) [68] and more
recently in 2007 by Borsari et al. [62].
In summary, there appear to be some social advantages of alcohol consumption for college
students, particularly during their first year at college when social identity is paramount.
Indeed, enhancement motives such as drinking to have a good time or to enjoy a party more
do not seem to have a strong association with alcohol problems. Drinking to cope with
negative emotional states or to reduce tension is consistently associated with alcohol-related
problems in college contexts. However, these high rates of drinking subsequently fall once
students graduate from college [69].
2 5"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:28","Thus the expectancy that consuming large quantities of alcohol will produce positive effects
such as reduction of social and sexual inhibition and indifference to potentially negative
effects such as cognitive impairment is associated with high risk drinking. However, a direct
relationship between personality type, alcohol expectancies and drinking behaviour cannot
be conclusively drawn due to the cross-sectional and small-scale nature of the studies in this
area.

2 6"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:29","5. Findings - Social
5.1 Age of first drinking
Most young people are introduced to alcohol by their parents [70] and the majority of young
people have had an alcoholic drink before the age of 16 [71]. Drinking at home under
parental supervision often began in childhood. Coleman and Carter (2003) reported that the
first experiences of drinking alcohol usually occurred between the ages of 8 and 12 years old
[72]. However, one review reported that a third of 3-4 year old children could able to tell the
difference between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks (using pictures) [73]. Also it has been
reported that children as young as 6 or 7 years old have already developed attitudes about
alcohol and have some knowledge about its use [74, 75]. Drinking in a parentally supervised
environment tends to peak around the age 13 or 14 [71, 72]. Whilst boys often experienced
their first drink younger than girls but these gender differences even out by age 13 or 14 [72].
A number of reviews reported that age of first use of alcohol is highly predictive of both
continued use and frequency of use [25, 63, 76-79]. Harolyn et al. (1998) reported that the
younger a child initiates alcohol and drug abuse, the higher the risk of serious health
consequences and adult substance abuse [77]. More specifically, it has been reported that
children who are introduced to alcohol before the age of 6 years are more than twice as likely
to report frequent, heavy or problematic drinking at age 15 compared to children who were
not exposed before the age of 13 years [80]. However, two reviews found that the age of the
first drink neither predicted alcohol use by age 20 nor the consequences from alcohol abuse
by age 30 [31] and that early drinking was only a modest predictor of heavy regular drinking
in later life [33].
The effect of the age at which young people first consumed alcohol was explored in relation
to later drinking behaviours in US college students. Saltz and Elandt (1986) reported that the
older an individual was at the time of their first drink, the lower the college student’s current
alcohol consumption was likely to be [63]. College students who had their first drink in
elementary school drank more heavily and at a higher frequency and experienced more
negative consequences as a result of their drinking than students with a later initiation to
alcohol [63].
However early onset of drinking does not always suggest higher long term risk. For instance,
subsequent epidemiological data suggest that early puberty in girls is associated with early
drinking but not adult alcoholism [38].
Zeigler et al. (2005) reported the number of young people aged 12-17 years from the USA
who had used alcohol increased from 2.2 to 3.1 million between 1995 and 2000 [25]. In this
review, most youths had their first drink around 12 years of age and the prevalence of
alcohol use increased with age [25]. They also found that individuals who first used alcohol in
the age range of 11-14 years had a much greater risk of subsequently developing alcohol
abuse or alcohol dependence than children who started drinking later; it was estimated that
40% of children who start drinking before the age of 15 years would develop alcohol abuse
or dependence [25]. Lastly they report that delaying the time of a young persons first drink
may reduce significantly the risk of harmful drinking [25].
Vingilis (1981) investigated the location of early drinking behaviour and reported that 20% of
adolescent ‘delinquents’ (students who had been in trouble with the law) had had their first
drink in the home environment compared to 75% of law-abiding students [81]. Thus the
location of the drinking initiation may be important for future outcomes, however the data in
this study related to 1967 [81]. Donovan (2004) reviewed research on parental norms and
the onset of drinking and via survival analyses showed that higher levels of parental alcohol
2 7"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:30","and drug use and more permissive parental attitudes about teen drinking were linked to
earlier alcohol initiation in children [82]. Lieberman (2000) reported that children who learned
from their parents that alcohol use led to positive outcomes had a greater risk of alcohol-
related problems than those who learned more negative expectancies [83]. Lastly, whilst
York (1999) stated that early alcohol use was linked to later alcohol misuse and / or
problems, they cautioned that but that the exact biological and social mechanisms were
disputed and that a causal relationship had not been demonstrated [84].
To summarise, early to alcohol may be associated with increased risk of alcohol-related
problems. However, the literature is unclear as to whether early alcohol exposure leads to
harmful consequences or if early drinking is more likely to occur in children who are at risk
due to other personal, familial or social factors. It is possible that different outcomes may
result from early alcohol exposure with peers or with parents, although parental drinking
practices or attitudes to alcohol may influence higher or lower risk drinking.
Levels of evidence
Of the 20 reviews used in this section, 4 reviews were categorised as 1+ (B); 6 as 2+ (C); 7
as 2-(C) and 3 as level 3 (D). Methodologically one review was of good quality with a low risk
of bias and six having a moderate probability that the relationship is causal, the remaining
reviews included evidence that was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk
of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal or non-
analytical studies.
5.2 Family effects of children’s drinking
The majority of reviews concurred with the conclusion that parental alcoholism increases the
probability of problem drinking and even chemical dependency in children [61, 66, 85, 86]. In
addition, it had been suggested that sibling and grandparental alcoholism also increased the
risk of alcoholism in the children [39, 87]. However, recent work has reported mixed findings
in this area [31]. Berowitz and Perkins (1986) reported that it was the economic and
emotional instabilities associated with alcohol abusing families that hampers the
development of a secure and emotionally stable child, which actually influences the
development of problematic drinking [88]. Moreover, Deas and Thomas (2002) stated that
even if a father was misusing alcohol and other drugs, his presence in the home may protect
against substance misuse in the adolescent compared to his absence [87]; a point supported
by others [82, 86]. Heath et al. cited in Rutter (2007) found no effect on child outcomes of the
duration of presence of an alcoholic parent in the home. Thus whilst there appears to be a
general consensus that there is a relationship between parental drinking patterns and their
offspring’s use of alcohol [63, 68] the underlying mechanism (e.g. genetic, indirect
environmental though quality of care or direct through exposure to alcohol use by parents)
remains unclear [38]. Further to this, it appears clear that children in disrupted families show
increased risk of early substance involvement and abuse / dependence, although the
underlying mechanisms remain uncertain [38].
Saltz and Elandt (1986) concluded that if both parents abstain from alcohol the likelihood is
their children will be abstainers, whilst if one or more parents drink then their offspring are
also more likely to drink [63]. An interesting addition to these findings was the suggestion that
male drinking is more closely related to the fathers’ drinking habits whilst female patterns are
correlated to both parents’ alcohol use [51] [63]. Sullivan et al. (2004) reinforced previous
findings that early initiation into drinking and growing up with a father who drank heavily were
strong predictors of heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems in US college students [78].
A key theme in three further reviews was the centrality of the father-son relationship in
influencing alcohol use both negatively and positively [66] [39] [62]. However, other reports
2 8"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:31","describe the maternal influence as more important than paternal effects [62] [66] [76]. Thus
the evidence of differential influence of parents on their sons and daughters is inconclusive.
More general research has concluded that good family relations can impact favourably upon
adolescent outcomes, including alcohol use [86, 89], whilst poor and conflictual relations
increase the likelihood of alcohol initiation and related problems [39, 88]. Allen et al. (2003)
discussed the role of family alcohol use in relation to a condoning effect on adolescent
alcohol use and concluded that both parents and peers influence a young person’s decisions
about substance use [90]. Denton (1994), reported that attempts by parents to express
disapproval for their children’s alcohol use can be perceived as ‘hypocritical morality’ by
children and therefore ineffective in preventing use [86]. Bosari et al. (2007) found that
children of alcohol approving parents experienced more negative consequences of alcohol
use compared to parents with more stringent views [62]. Also parents who set clear limits
about drinking can reduce the influence of drinking peers [62]. However extremes of control
can be dysfunctional for the development of sensible drinking behaviour in teenagers [91].
Foxcroft and Lowe (1991) have suggested the existence of a curvilinear relationship between
levels of parental control whereby clear boundaries offered protection to adolescent alcohol
misuse while excessively lax or strict parenting increased frequency of misuse [71].
Genetically informed data suggest that ‘harsh forms of physical punishment have an
environmentally mediated influence on both disruptive behaviour and drug or alcohol
misuse’[38]. Interestingly, Vakalhi (2001) argues that young people who are drinking may
seek help from an older sibling to act as a bridge between family and peers [92].
In summary, a wide array of parental factors correlate with different aspects of adolescent
drinking. However correlation is not the same as causation, and in a familial context other
‘common factors’ are likely to influence drinking outcomes. There is also conflicting evidence
in this area which may be due to methodological limitations of the research [39, 48, 68, 93].
However, it is reasonable to assume that parents can and do influence the drinking
behaviour of their children and that there are likely to be problems associated with being
either overly lax or restrictive regarding alcohol use.
Levels of evidence
Of the 22 reviews used in this section, 1 review was categorised as 1++ (A); 2 as 1+ (B); 2 as
2++ (B); 5 as 2+ (C); 9 as 2- (C) and 3 as level 3 (D). Methodologically one review was of
excellent quality with a very low risk of bias; two had a low risk of bias; two a very little risk of
bias; two a moderate probability that the relationship is causal. The remaining 17 reviews
included evidence that was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk of
confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal or non-analytical
studies.
5.3 Peer Groups
Engels (2003) considered the issue of adolescent alcohol use from a developmental
perspective, in which young people attempted to seek greater autonomy from parents as
they mature which heightens their integration with (and an increased influence of) peer
groups [94]. Evidence suggests that increased alcohol use is associated with adolescents
spending more time on social activities [95, 96] and there is also a relationship between
talking about problems with peers and drinking [76, 97-99]. Thus, alcohol use (although level
not defined) can have a positive impact on peer relationships. However this association
reported to be stronger in males compared to females and in older young people such as
university students [100]. In a review of studies of 16-20 year olds, Brown et al. (2008) state
that there may be some constructive aspects in young people’s alcohol use with regards to
developmental tasks such as ‘identity exploration’ and bonding with peers [101].
2 9"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:32","Engels (2003) review found that drinking and pub going by adolescents facilitated the sharing
of activities, experiences and emotions with peers and that this engagement with their peer
group is associated with healthier emotional functioning while avoiding these activities is
associated with lack of social integration, low self-esteem and feelings of depression [94].
However, causality is difficult to ascertain it is not possible to determine if drinking leads to a
better social network or if good social networking leads to increased drinking behaviour.
In considering the influence of peers and possible deviant peer affiliation, it is increasingly
thought that young people may select like-minded peers to interact with rather than be
influenced by peer-pressure. Since behavioural risks cluster, it is thought that genetically
predisposed children raised in adverse circumstances and experiencing ‘deficits in parenting’
have an increase risk of deviant peer affiliation (Heath et al). Schmidt and Hankoff (1979)
argue that such social groupings stem from a need to belong because of early familial
deprivation [102] and Stacey and Davies (1970) reported strong associations between
feelings of alienation, normlessness and powerlessness and favourable attitudes towards the
irresponsible use of alcohol among high school students [103].
The majority of work examining the effect of alcohol on friendships has focused on college
students. It is likely that alcohol use is important to young people when making the transition
from school to college [101, 104, 105]. As university students are often found to drink more
than their non student peers, it has been suggested that this context may lead to increased
opportunities to socialise and drink heavily [106]. Excessive drinking and drunkenness have
often been seen by some as a “right of passage” for college students [107]. Perhaps
unsurprisingly alcohol use is viewed as more desirable by college peers than other drug use
[63].
In the American literature there is a particular focus on Greek fraternities. Baer (2002) cites a
study by Cashin et al. (1988) that reported members of Greek fraternities found alcohol to be
a vehicle for friendship more than non fraternity members. More generally students selected
friends that drunk in a similar manner to themselves [68].
However, other studies have shown that college students have lost friends through their
alcohol consumption [106]. Gill (2002) cites a study by Orford et al. (1974) that reported 8.5%
of male students and 3.5% of female students had broken or damaged friendships through
drink [106]. In a further cited study by Gill (2002), West el al. (1990) found that 3.2% of males
and 0.7% of females admitted losing friends due to drinking [106].
Reviews show that involvement in ‘drinking games’ by students is consistently associated
with higher alcohol consumption [68, 108]. Borsari (2004) explored interpersonal differences
between students that played drinking games and those that did not. They found that
students engaged in drinking games to facilitate disinhibition, while social anxiety was
associated with lower rates of playing and lower levels of drinking in those that played
drinking games [108]. Although the level of consumption when engaging in drinking games is
of concern, Baer (2002) found that once general alcohol use rates were controlled, game
playing did not contribute to alcohol related problems [68].
In summary, friendships and sociability is one area where there is evidence that alcohol use
by young people may have some benefits. In both adolescents and students it is likely to play
a role in ‘bonding’ with peers and may lead to greater sociability. However, studies have also
shown that alcohol use at certain levels may have detrimental effects on friendship. Further
investigation of what levels of consumption these effects occur should be considered.

5.4 Alcohol and other drug use
There has been discussion about the idea that one substance may represent a ‘gateway’ to
other substances [109, 110]. Saltz and Elandt (1986) found that college students who used
alcohol were more likely to use cannabis and to hold approving views about its use than their
abstaining peers [63]. Boyd, McCabe and Morales (2005) found some evidence that a
relationship existed between cocaine use and binge drinking in students from one college
[31]. However, Smart and Ogborne (2000) and Golub and Johnson (1998) found no
relationship between alcohol use and the use of drugs other than cannabis [111, 112]. To
summarise, the link between alcohol and other drug use is not conclusively shown.

studies.
5.5 Sexual risk taking
Alcohol use is correlated with having first sexual experience at a younger age [101, 113].
Leigh et al. (2008) included 13 studies (4 of which looked at adolescents). Results of the
meta-analysis showed an association, of borderline significance, between alcohol
consumption and non-use of condoms at first time sexual intercourse (this was not found
amongst adults). However, they concluded that lifestyle factors such as a propensity for risk
taking, sensation-seeking or unconventionality might lead to both alcohol use and
unprotected sex in these events. Therefore a link between drinking and unprotected sex in
first sexual encounters might be linked to these personality factors rather than a causal effect
of alcohol [114].
In a review of substance misuse, including alcohol use, in 11-19 years olds, Kerr and Matlak
(1998) reported a link between alcohol use and the likelihood of having sex in adolescents
[115]. They also found a link between alcohol use and the likelihood of having unprotected
sex although the relationship was not as strong. A third of students who were 12 years or
younger at first intoxication reported that alcohol caused them to engage in unplanned sex as
apposed to less than 5% of those who reported never having being intoxicated [116].
Clark (2004) reported that adolescent females with alcohol use disorders (AUDs), compared
to those without AUDs were more likely to have sexually transmitted infections [51]. Clark
also reported that adolescents with AUDs are more likely to become pregnant as teenagers.
However aside from one study cited in Clark 2004 [51], and despite anecdotal evidence
suggesting a causal link between alcohol and teenage pregnancy, we found no other studies
that directly explore this link.
3 1"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:34","Boyd et al. (2005) also reported that heavy drinking (undefined amount of alcohol) amongst
students (aged 18-24) was associated with high risk sexual behaviour and sexual aggression
[31]. Thus they speculated about the potential for alcohol to interfere with the development
of intimate relationships. In a review of drinking in UK university students Gill (2002) reported
a relationship between alcohol and risks such as unplanned pregnancy and HIV infection as
well as becoming more sexually involved with someone than they would normally have
wanted [106]. Murgraff et al.(1999) cites studies that show that alcohol consumption
increases the likelihood of unprotected sex [117]. Cooper (2002) also reported a link between
drinking and students decisions to have sex and with forms of risky sex such as having
multiple or casual sex partners [118]. Nevertheless, Cooper (2002) concluded that although
alcohol use and sexual behaviour covaried this did not mean that alcohol use ‘causes’ risky
sexual behaviours since there may be another unknown factor that links the two [118].
Indeed, a meta-analysis [119] of sexual encounters and their links with alcohol showed that
with the exception of first sexual intercourse, the link between alcohol and condom use was
weak.
In summary, there are methodological weaknesses in the studies assessing the relationship
between alcohol and sexual behaviour and a causal relationship has not clearly been
demonstrated [115, 120]. Indeed Fossey et al. (1996) conclude that all that can be concluded
from studies of adolescents and sexual behaviour is that some people are more generally
inclined to take risks [15, 120]. Nevertheless, the weight of associations while not conclusive
suggests that alcohol can contribute to misjudgements about sexual behaviour.

evidence that was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or

5.6 Academic performance
Loveland-Cherry (2005) reports that school attachment and receiving good grades have
been associated with less adolescent alcohol use, while absenteeism and poor grades are
associated with early initiation and increased levels of alcohol use [121]. Perkins et al. (2002)
found that male students who drank more than 5 drinks, and female students that drank
more than 4 drinks, in a session one or two times in a 2 week period were over three times
more likely to report getting behind in school work compared with more moderate drinkers
[69]. When the drinking frequency increased to 3 times in a 2 week period, they were more
than eight times more likely to report this problem [69]. Berkowitz and Perkins (1987) found
that women students were as likely as men to experience impaired academic performance
due to alcohol [122].
Most reviews which looked at educational performance related to American college students
and the majority evidence points to the fact that the association between academic
performance and college drinking is inconclusive. A number of reviews have discussed the
methodological limitations of studies that investigate the relationship between alcohol and
academic performance [78]. Much of the cited evidence for a relationship comes from cross
sectional studies which cannot ascribe a causal link. However, there is emerging evidence
from longitudinal studies which suggesting binge drinking may impair academic performance
over time. Nevertheless, it is noted that most college students who drink go on to lead
successful lives [31]. Indeed Gill (2002) argues that alcohol may be a scapegoat for other
factors that may limit poor academic performance [106].
3 2"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:35","In summary, more research evidence is required before the question of whether or not
alcohol has a detrimental effect on academic performance can be answered - it is also
essential that pattern of drinking be considered [63, 106].

5.7 Offending
It has been found that younger people who drink are more likely to be both perpetrators and
victims of violence [2]. Although there is some evidence to show that there is a link between
alcohol and violent behaviour in adolescents [123] and weapon carrying [123], it is difficult to
ascertain a causal relationship. Giancola (2002) reported that there was modest to good
support that expectancies interact with alcohol to increase aggression; it was explained that
alcohol can detrimentally affect certain psychological and/or physiological processes that
then lead to the expression of aggressive behaviour [124].
Mezler-Lange’s (1998) report that alcohol is related to weapon carrying and fighting [123]. It
was found that, as well as heavy drinking in the past month, other statistical predictors of
carrying a weapon to school were being male, not living with both parents, not feeling close
to parents, participating in a fight in the last year, damaging school property and perceiving at
least a few other students to have bought weapons to school on the day of the survey were
also statistically significant in predicting the student carrying a weapon to school [123].
Women however, were less likely to be involved in offending behaviour than men [122].
Thus, there are clearly factors which will influence weapon carrying other than alcohol.
Furthermore, Markowittz (2000) found that while beer and marijuana are linked with a higher
likelihood of teenagers engaging in fights, no substances lead to increased probability of
carrying a knife, gun or other weapon [125].
In a review of studies examining whether young people charged with alcohol related offences
are problem drinkers, Vingilis (1981) concludes that it is not possible to determine whether
the drinking of young people charged with alcohol related offences is any greater than that of
other young people from the same socio-economic groups [81].
Thunstrom (1988) focused on children up to the age of 16 who were apprehended for
drunkenness. This review concluded that the prognosis for a child apprehended for
drunkenness is often serious and that the risk for a child that is apprehended for
drunkenness of developing alcoholism is about 20% [27]. There is also an increased risk of
criminality, future illness and death at an early age, predominantly caused by suicide and
violent accidents is also increased [27].
Alcohol related assaults are common on university campuses [31]. Furthermore alcohol
consumption also increases the risk of being a victim particularly in heavy drinkers (not
defined) [124]. Alcohol is also implicated in many sexual assaults on college campuses [126].
Alcohol use by the victim and / or perpetrator is frequently associated with acquaintance
rape. Abbey (1991) found that alcohol use at the time of the attack was one of the four
strongest predictors of the likelihood of a college woman’s being raped [126]. Dowdall and
Wechsler (2002) also indicates that alcohol misuse is strongly associated with the risk of
sexual assault [127]. However although alcohol related assaults are common a number of
reviewers caution against assuming a simplistic link between the two variables and argue
3 3"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:36","that there are likely to be multiple ‘pathways’ linking these factors [15, 31, 124, 126].
Giancola (2002) for example states that increasing evidence indicates that ’intoxicated
aggression is the product of individual difference and contextual variables interacting with
alcohol pharamacodynamics’[124].
Newburn and Shiners (2001) also agree that the relationship between offending and alcohol
consumption is complex and that other ‘risk factors are shared’. These are parental
substance use, conduct problems in middle childhood and affiliations with ‘delinquent peers’
[2]. This was also found by others [2, 81, 128, 129].
It is likely that intoxication facilitates aggression most in those individuals that are already
inclined to aggression [128]. Plant and Plant (2001) state that the effects of alcohol on
behaviour depend on ‘an interaction between the drinker and context of drinking as well as
chemistry of ethyl alcohol’ [15].
To summarise although there is evidence of a relationship between alcohol use and
offending in adolescents and students, a number of reviewers have cautioned against
assuming a simplistic relationship and state that it is likely that other risk factors including
individual differences and contextual variables will play an important role. However, alcohol
may facilitate offending in those who are already predisposed.

as level 3 (D). Methodologically one review had a moderate risk of bias with the remaining
reviews included evidence that was related to case control or cohort studies with a high risk
of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal or non-
analytical studies.
5.8 Religion
The evidence exploring the effect of religion and alcohol use in young people is mainly
restricted to college students based in the USA. The general consensus is that a religious
affiliation reduces alcohol consumption in students however there is conflicting evidence as
to what degree and which religion provides the greatest protection [63, 68, 88]. It is
suggested that depth of religious commitment may be a better predictor of alcohol use than
the simple measure of religious involvement [88].
Baer (2002) also found that students who were more religious and more committed to
traditional values drink less [68] concluding that a belief that ‘religion was important’ was
significantly and independently related to reduced frequency of heavy drinking compared to
students with no religious affiliations [68]. Furthermore, Berkowitz (1986) added that more
frequent attendance at religious services and greater strength of faith were linked to less
problematic drinking in US college students [88].
Levels of evidence

"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:37","6. Summary of findings and concluding remarks
A distillation of the findings from this review are summarised in Table 3. Within table 3,
reference numbers and grade of evidence are shown where appropriate.
The focus of this work was a review of reviews of the harms and benefits of alcohol and
young people. It is clear that many of the review in this field are now quite old (around half
pre-2000) and a large number were based on data from the USA (around half). The majority
of the reviews found related to adolescents and college/university students. Thus they have
limited generalisability to contemporary drinking behaviour by young people in the UK. In
addition, most of the review work was methodologically weak and so it is not possible to have
a high degree of confidence about their conclusions. Future work may need to include a
further review of the primary data literature and may perhaps include a review of intervention
studies relating to alcohol and young people.
In addition, there was a repeated theme in this body of work in which correlations were
reported for a wide range of personal, familial and social factors and alcohol misuse. In
addition, alcohol misuse was often correlated with a wide range of health and social
consequences. However, it was generally not possible to determine that key risk factors
‘caused’ alcohol misuse or that the latter specifically led to the adverse effects. Further to this
in the main it was not possible to ascertain the levels of alcohol that led to adverse
consequences as was the hope of the results of this review of reviews.
Nevertheless, there is a very large body of review work that has accumulated over many
years and from this evidence some consistent themes emerged.
It is relatively clear from this literature that both early initiation into drinking and heavy alcohol
consumption can lead to a very wide range of adverse consequences for young people’s
physical and mental health. These adverse effects consisted of both short-term (acute) and
longer term health problems. There is a need for more services for young people to be able
to deal with the adverse consequences of drinking.
We found few positive effects of drinking on young people’s health, with the exception of
some social and emotional coping functions of drinking that may help with a sense of positive
mental well-being.
There is also a large literature that characterises risk factors that can lead young people to
begin drinking earlier in life or to drink large amounts of alcohol. From this body of work, key
groups that are particularly vulnerable to alcohol’s adverse effects can be characterised.
These key groups are young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and / or
broken homes who begin to drink early and who may have concurrent psychiatric or
behavioural disorder problems. Also children of parents with alcohol-related problems may
be particularly vulnerable to developing problems with alcohol themselves. One practical
indicator of such young people is alcohol presentations at emergency services on week
nights (as opposed to the weekend) and parents who show minimal anxiety about the
hospital visit.
We also identified some factors that may have a protective effect on children’s age of
initiation and subsequent use of alcohol. In particular, good family relations and parents with
an accurate and well-balanced knowledge about the effects that alcohol on health and well
being may help to protect children from the adverse effects of drinking.
3 5"
"Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Young People.pdf,page:38","However, this field of work is riddled with many interlinked variables related to both risks and
consequences of drinking by young people. However, it is difficult to tease these variables
apart and establish the actual relationships between them. Thus it is not possible to ascribe a
causal link between individuals’ personal attributes or life-circumstances and drinking
behaviour, or indeed alcohol use and a wide range of activities that may result from drinking
(but that may also arise due to other unidentified variable(s). As one author reported, we
know that a lot of students drink a lot and we know that a lot of students have unsafe sex;
however, what we do not know is whether the two things are directly related.
For obvious ethical reasons, it is not possible to design prospective studies or controlled
trials to elucidate the issue of behavioural causality in this field. Thus it is necessary to rely
on well-designed longitudinal studies and prospective cross-sectional work that is of
sufficient scale to allow multivariate analysis which can control for confounding and
interactional factors. However, many of the primary research studies that were cited in the
reviews that we have reported were small scale and methodologically weak. Unfortunately,
this review of reviews was not able to identify any meta-analyses of the recent large-scale
survey work that has occurred in the UK and which has reported multivariate analyses of
different dependent variables that may influence (or arise from) drinking behaviour. A key
advance in this field would be to establish whether there are primary survey data based on
UK populations available and if not to carry out a well-conducted meta-analysis of such
areas.
A final remark is that most of the research work on alcohol consumption by young people
uses imprecise measures of alcohol use. Thus studies report concepts such as alcohol
misuse, abuse, disorders and dependence. We identified no work that reported specific
levels of alcohol consumed in terms of standard drink units or blood alcohol counts. Thus
from the research to date, it is not possible to link different levels of alcohol consumption to
different outcomes. Hence with a view to the formulation of recommendations about alcohol
risk reduction for children and young people, it is not easy to conclude that drinking to
differing degrees will produce commensurate effects. Thus future research in this field needs
to include more precise measurement of alcohol use by young people so that this can be
more easily related to specific health or social outcomes and psychometric measures of risk
or harm due to drinking in young people.

Effects of Absti nence from Tobacco
A Critical Review
JOHN R. HUGHES, STEPHEN T. HIGGINS,
and DOROTHY HATSUKAMI
1. INTRODUCTION
Many smokers, ex-smokers, and scientists have strong opinions about the effects of
abstinence from tobacco. Some believe the effects are mild, are not true withdrawal
phenomena, and have little to do with the inability of smokers to stop. Others believe
abstinence effects can produce significant distress, are similar to the classical with
drawal syndromes of opiates and sedatives, and account for much of the inability of
smokers to stop.
Over the last 40-50 years, the withdrawal syndromes from opiates (e.g., Martin,
1977; Katz and Valentino, 1986), alcohol (e.g., Mello and Mendelson, 1977), seda
tives/hypnotics (Woods et aI., 1987), and benzodiazepines have been well characterized
(Fig. 1) and determinants of withdrawal, such as dose and duration of drug use, have
been well delineated (e.g., Kalant et aI., 1971; Martin, 1977). Finally, the role of
withdrawal in the maintenance and cessation of such drugs has been empirically studied
(Cappell and Leblanc, 1971).
In contrast, well-designed, systematic studies of abstinence from tobacco have
been completed only in the last 5 years. Of the several possibilities to explain the lag in
studying tobacco withdrawal, two appear salient. First, consensus that smoking is a drug
dependence is a new phenomenon, only appearing in the 1980s (American Psychiatric
Association, 1980; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1983). Second, with a few excep
tions (e.g., Grunberg, 1985), animal models of withdrawal so helpful with opiates and
alcohol have not been well developed.
Recent interest in tobacco withdrawal may be due to several factors. One pos-

1. INTRODUCTION
Generalization of scientific findings is contingent on replication of results. This is
particularly critical for research concerning the correlates and prediction of human
behavior where cultural and temporal factors may alter findings. Alcohol-related longi
tudinal research is rich and bountiful; it permits exploration of the degree to which
replication of findings has taken place, particularly replication across differing cultural
and temporal frames, and the development of research strategies that might provide tests
of replication.
The longitudinal research design, itself, is a persuasive technique for examining a
number of research questions with regard to human behavior in general and alcohol
related behavior in particular. This design can (I) determine the antecedents of particular
behaviors, (2) assess and describe the incidence and chronicity/remission of behaviors
and their correlates, and (3) differentiate in the timing of antecedents and correlates of
behaviors (Clausen, 1978). Longitudinal research designs using normal representative
populations are ideal for shedding light on the understudied and little-understood issues
of incidence, chronicity, and remission of given drinking patterns and alcohol problems
over the life course and their correlates and antecedents, for assessing social change as it

influences individual lives, for assessing the relationship of alcohol use to morbidity and
mortality, and for disentangling biological, social, and personality factors (and their
possible interactions) as they contribute to the incidence, chronicity, and remission of
drinking patterns and problems.
This chapter deals with three major research findings emerging from the alcohol
related longitudinal literature, which has used, for the most part, general population
samples. The three general research findings are: (1) an antecedent to serious alcohol
problems is youthful antisocial behavior (conduct disorder); (2) an antecedent to serious
alcohol problems is a genetic predisposition to them; (3) environmental change on the
aggregate level can govern the incidence, chronicity, and remission of serious alcohol
problems on the individual level.
This chapter considers the degree to which these findings have actually been
replicated across existing studies, the degree to which the studies suffer from meth
odological wl!aknesses, and the degree to which the subjects in these studies represent
culturally and historically distinct groups of people, thereby contributing to stronger
statements regarding generalization. Further, the chapter not only is oriented toward a
critical appraisal of the research findings as they now exist, but also proposes new
research strategies which would systematically replicate findings and correct meth
odological weaknesses.
2. RESEARCH FINDING 1: AN ANTECEDENT TO SERIOUS
ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IS YOUTHFUL ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR
(CONDUCT DISORDER)
A tradition of studies from the 1950s sought to locate behaviors in childhood and
youth that would ultimately predict alcohol-related adult behaviors. Although not all of
them focused on ""deviant"" youth, many did. For instance, Robins utilized a longitudi
nal design of white, child-guidance-clinic patients (Robins, 1966); the McCords used
delinquency-prone boys (McCord and McCord, 1962); Vaillant used a sample of Har
vard students and also a sample of inner-city boys (Vaillant, 1983); and Monnelly and
his colleagues used a sample of boys in residential treatment for youth with behavioral
problems (Monnelly et aI., 1983). On the other hand, Jones's sample (1968, 1971) was
white and middle class, while Amundsen's sample consisted of all 19-year-old boys
screened for the military in Norway (Amundsen, 1982).
The ages of measurement for these studies differed as well: Robins measured males
between ages 13 and 46; the McCords measured boys between a mean age of 8 until they
reached their 30s; Vaillant's college students were measured first at age 18 and then at
age 59 and his inner-city boys at 16 and 47; Monnelly et al.'s boys were under age 16 at
Time 1 and over 60 at Time 2; Jones's sample was 10 years old at first measurement and
43 at last measurement; Amundsen's universe of boys was first measured at age 19 and
last measured at age 50.
Taken together, these studies suggest that boys exhibiting antisocial behavior at
first measurement tend to become alcoholic more often than boys who do not. Further,
they tend to experience other problems in adulthood (see Robins, 1984, for a review of"

Summary
• The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and
injury conditions
• Alcohol is metabolised in the body via oxidation and elimination
• The risks of incurring harms from drinking increase the more an individual
drinks, and these harms affect the brain, the heart, the liver, digestive and
endocrine systems, the immune system and many more areas of the body
• There is also convincing evidence that alcohol consumption causes cancer – it
has been listed as a Group 1 carcinogen for over 30 years
Introduction
Alcohol affects health in a variety of ways; virtually every system of the human body can be
damaged by its harmful consumption. The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more
than 200 disease and injury conditions.1
This briefing details the ways in which alcohol affects individual physical and mental health.

"The-physical-and-mental-health-effects-of-alcohol.pdf,page:4","The effects of alcohol on physical health
Alcohol is metabolised in the body using two processes:
• Oxidation: body cells combine oxygen with dissolved food in the bloodstream, leading
to the release of heat and energy (calories) to be used for cell maintenance and
repair. Alcohol calories are burnt immediately. Oxidation deals with over 90% of
alcohol consumed.
• Elimination: between 2% and 10% of alcohol consumed escapes unused via breath,
urine or sweat glands.
For all types of alcohol-related harm, risk increases the more an individual drinks.1 The
effects of excessive alcohol consumption are described below:
Figure 1 The effects of high-risk drinking
Brain: As a depressant of the central nervous system, alcohol interferes with the brain’s
communication pathways. This occurs by the penetration of the blood-brain barrier, which
otherwise prevents or slows the passage of some drugs and other harmful substances from
the blood into the central nervous system. These disruptions can change mood and
behaviour, and make it harder to think clearly and move with coordination. The degree to
which brain activity slows down depends on how much, and how fast, a person drinks.
Some effects people experience include: altered speech; hazy thinking; slowed reaction
time; dulled hearing; impaired vision; weakened muscles; and foggy memory.
Over a long period of time, heavy drinkers may develop various types of physical brain
damage; chronic alcohol dependence is associated with extensive brain damage and
cognitive deficits leading in extreme cases to conditions such as alcoholic dementia, a loss
of intellectual functioning combined with amnesia. Post-mortem studies have suggested that"
"The-physical-and-mental-health-effects-of-alcohol.pdf,page:5","PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL 5
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome – one such form of alcohol-related dementia associated with
alcohol misuse – occurs in about 2% of the general population and 12.5% of dependent
drinkers.2
These are due in part to the toxic effects of alcohol itself, but long term alcohol misuse can
also lead to vitamin deficiencies that exacerbate the damage.3 Alcohol-induced brain
damage can be partially reversible if identified and treated in time.4
Heart: The impact of alcohol on the heart has long been debated in the scientific literature,
with recent expert opinion increasingly supporting the view that the benefits for heart health
of drinking alcohol are less and apply to a smaller group of the population than previously
thought. This conclusion was reached in the Chief Medical Officers’ 2016 report of the UK’s
alcohol consumption guidelines. Expert evidence provided for the paper showed that the
only group with potential to have an overall significant reduction in risk of death in the UK is
women over the age of 55 (especially if drinking around five units a week or less), but that
heart disease was a significant risk factor for heavy drinking in the short-term and regular
drinking in the long-term.5
A meta-analysis of evidence from more than 50 studies that linked drinking habits and
cardiovascular health for over 260,000 people found that ‘reducing the amount of alcoholic
beverages consumed, even for light-to-moderate drinkers, may improve cardiovascular
health, including a reduced risk of coronary heart disease’.6 This has since been followed
by an international review of nearly 4 million respondents from 87 studies, which has shown
that previous research ‘over-estimated the possible health benefits of alcohol and under-
estimated its health risks’.7
Whether consumed as wine, beer, or spirits, the alcohol content remains the same; a glass
of wine, 250ml of ordinary strength beer and a single measure of spirits are all equal in their
impact on health.8 Therefore, large quantities of alcohol – regardless of beverage type – can
affect how the heart works, and in turn, the rest of the body, for if the heart isn't pumping
blood throughout the body effectively, other organs may suffer from lack of oxygen or
nutrients.9
The pattern of consumption can also have an adverse effect on the organ’s function. Heavy
consumption either during a single occasion or over a long period can cause and aggravate
heart conditions such as cardiomyopathy (stretching and drooping of heart muscle) and
arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), and may also lead to strokes and high blood pressure.
Liver: The liver is the major detoxifying organ of the body; it is responsible for processing
what we eat and drink into nutrients and energy, as well as removing harmful substances
from the blood. Most of the alcohol a person drinks is eventually broken down by the liver.
As the body cannot store alcohol, it is treated as a potential poison and eliminated via the
liver, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol. Hence, alcoholic
liver disease is the most likely type of physiological condition to result from persistent or
chronic heavy alcohol consumption. The most recent official figures found alcoholic liver
disease to be responsible for the majority of alcohol-related deaths in England.10
The alcohol that is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine enters the portal vein that
leads directly to the liver. The liver then effectively removes alcohol from the body by"

changing it to other compounds. However, too much alcohol can fast overwhelm your liver’s
capacity to metabolise, and consequently your blood alcohol level rises.
Some liver damage comes from free radicals, a group of molecules that are highly reactive.
These molecules can attack the nearest stable molecule, leading to a dangerous chain
reaction that can result in a disease called cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis occurs when scar
tissue replaces normal, healthy tissue and the liver, which needs unrestricted blood flow,
doesn't work as it should.11
The body's natural defences against free radicals (eg antioxidants) can be inhibited by
alcohol consumption, leading to increased liver damage.12 Heavy drinking over a period of
years can damage the liver, causing inflammations such as steatosis (fatty liver) alcoholic
hepatitis, and fibrosis. A number of studies support a ‘small’ causal relationship between
consumption and risk of developing liver cancer.13
Digestive and endocrine systems: Alcohol is not digested like other foods; it avoids the
normal digestive process and goes straight into the bloodstream. About 20% of the alcohol
consumed is absorbed in the stomach, and about 80% is absorbed in the small intestine.
Alcohol increases acid in the stomach, which in heavy drinkers can lead to severe stomach
pain or sores in the intestines. One way to help prevent the increase of acid is by eating
while drinking, as food slows down the rate at which alcohol is absorbed by the body.14
The action of hormone release is complex. Hormones must be released at the right time, to
the right tissues in the body. Alcohol can impair both the functions of the glands that release
hormones and the tissues to which they are being sent. Drinking heavily can cause a steep
rise in blood sugar, to which the pancreas responds by producing insulin to lower the blood
sugar. But if it rises too steeply, the resulting overproduction of insulin can actually lead to
low blood sugar, a condition called hypoglycaemia. This is especially dangerous for
diabetics, especially those taking certain drugs to lower their blood sugar.
Alcohol also affects the endocrine system by interfering with how the body absorbs calcium,
a chemical necessary for bone strength. As a result, people who drink heavily may be at a
higher risk for osteoporosis, a disease in which bone density declines. If bones aren’t strong,
there is a greater possibility of fractures.
Immune system and sexual health: From having frequent colds to numbness, heavy or
hazardous drinking on a single occasion slows your body’s ability to ward off infections, even
up to 24 hours after getting drunk. Over time, chronic drinkers are more liable to contract
diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis than those who do not drink above the
recommended guidelines.
Men or boys who drink large amounts of alcohol can experience a loss of testosterone, the
hormone that regulates male sexual function and semen. As a result, they could experience
erectile dysfunction and emotional changes.
Some women find that they are more affected by alcohol while ovulating or when they are
premenstrual. This is because it takes alcohol longer to be metabolised, leading to a higher
blood alcohol concentration. Women using oral contraceptives may not become intoxicated
as quickly as they would otherwise, because of the contraceptive's ability to delay the
absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream."

Heavy drinking is already known to be a possible cause of infertility, but a Danish study
found that even small amounts of alcohol can affect fertility.15
Foetal Alcohol Syndrome: Exposure to alcohol can affect pregnant women too. By
crossing the placental barrier, alcohol can affect a foetus by stunting its growth or weight,
creating distinctive facial stigmata, and damaging the structure of the central nervous system
in development. This can result in psychological or behavioural problems at birth, and
physical symptoms such as an abnormally small head, defective development of mid facial
tissues, minor outer ear abnormalities, abnormally small eyes, and heart and genital defects.
Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is the most involved end of the Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder
spectrum, a neurodevelopmental condition with lifelong cognitive, emotional and
behavioural challenges. In addition to effects on the brain, FASD is a full-body diagnosis
that can include more than 400 known conditions.16
Other common diagnoses made are: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder
(ARND); Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD); Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with
Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE).17
Diagnosing FASDs can be hard because there is no medical test for these conditions, but
some of the signs doctors look for include: prenatal alcohol exposure (although confirmation
is not required to make a diagnosis); central nervous system problems (eg small head size,
problems with attention and hyperactivity, poor coordination); lower-than-average height,
weight, or both; and abnormal facial features (eg smooth ridge between nose and upper lip)
Cancers: The International Agency for Research into Cancer (IARC) has classified alcohol
as a Group 1 carcinogen since 1988, Group 1 being the highest risk category. This means
that there is convincing evidence that alcohol causes cancer.18
Alcohol consumption may give rise to malignant tumours via the toxic metabolite
acetaldehyde, which is mutagenic and can cause cancer by damaging DNA and preventing
it from being repaired.19 Drinking alcohol greatly increases the level of acetaldehyde found
in saliva.20 A small initial study published in 2012 found higher levels of DNA damage in the
mouth cells of people after drinking alcohol.21
The 2010 IARC Monograph concluded that alcohol is causally linked (to varying degrees) to
several cancers – especially that of the oral cavity, pharynx (upper throat), larynx (voice
box), oesophagus, liver, breast, and colorectum – and that, in many cases, the risk of cancer
increases in a dose-dependent manner (ie risk increases with the volume consumed).22
All types of alcoholic drinks, including wine, beer and spirits, can increase the risk of cancer.
The risk is linked to the actual alcohol (ethanol) in the drink.23
A study published in 2015 found that alcohol is responsible for around 3.3% of UK cancers,
11,984 cases per year.24

"The-physical-and-mental-health-effects-of-alcohol.pdf,page:9","The effects of alcohol on mental health
In the long run, the effects of alcohol on the brain can be both psychological (mental health
problems) and physiological (damage to brain tissue). People who drink heavily are
particularly vulnerable, and alcohol is an influential factor in a number of conditions, including
anxiety and depression, psychotic disorders, and suicide. For instance, it is common for
people who have a mental health problem such as anxiety, depression, or schizophrenia, to
‘self-medicate’ the distressing symptoms of their condition using alcohol.1 In England and
Wales, it is estimated that alcohol is associated with 15 – 25% of all suicides and 65% of all
suicide attempts. In Scotland, 53% of people committing suicide who had contact with
mental health services in the 12 months prior to death had a history of alcohol misuse.2
Alcohol dependence also delays recovery from co-existing psychiatric conditions.3 One
answer to a parliamentary question revealed that in 2012/13, there were roughly 23,000
alcohol treatment clients receiving care from mental health services for reasons other than
substance misuse in England.4 The risk of dependence jumps dramatically for men who
exceed 7/8 drinks per occasion, for women 5/6 drinks per occasion (ie binge drinking
levels).5 Heavy steady chronic drinking at sufficiently high levels can also lead to the
physiological changes that result in alcohol dependence.6
In addition, researchers who have tried to elucidate the relationship between alcohol
consumption and aggression have suggested that people with a psychiatric condition called
antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) may be particularly susceptible to alcohol-related
aggression. One US survey of over 20,000 people found that those who met the American
Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for
ASPD (DSM-IV) were 21 times more likely to develop alcohol abuse and dependence at
some point during their lives than those who did not have ASPD.7

ABSTRACT
We study the impact of legal access to alcohol on a range of behavioral and physical outcomes of
U.S. Army soldiers in a regression discontinuity design. The wealth of novel data collected by the
military on cognitive ability, psychological health, and family history allows us to explore how
impacts vary with risk factors for alcohol consumption. Overall, we observe a large and
significant increase in drinking after the 21st birthday, but the increases are largest amongst those
who were depressed, had a family history of mental health problems, had better coping ability,
and had higher cognitive ability. Despite the large increase in consumption, we do not find any
meaningful impacts of legal access to alcohol - overall or in any sub-group - on any of the short-
term outcomes we observe, including suicidal tendencies, depression, tobacco use, physical
fitness, psychological health, deployability, smoking, and job-related infractions.
Acknowledging the limitations for extrapolation out of sample, we discuss the policy implications
of our results.

Alcohol is a pervasive part of our society, and its consumption can have widespread conse-
quences. Plausible theoretical arguments can link alcohol to numerous adverse outcomes, such as
death, crime, sexual activity, poor educational performance, unemployment, low job productivity,
the use of related vices such as drugs and tobacco, poor inter- and intra-personal relationships,
and mental and physical health problems. Importantly, the impacts of alcohol consumption are

Despitecleartheoreticalpathways,itisdifficulttoestimatecausalrelationshipsempiricallybe-
cause of either unobserved joint factors that determine both drinking and adverse outcomes (e.g.,
lack of self-control may precipitate both alcohol consumption and poor education outcomes) or
reverse causality (e.g., poor mental health can induce one to consume alcohol). The most credible
empirical estimates to date of the impacts of alcohol consumption come from regression disconti-
nuity (RD) designs around the U.S. Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) of 21 years. The RD
approach compares individuals just before and after their 21st birthday, and relies on the assump-
tion that there are no other factors influencing alcohol consumption or outcomes of interest at this
threshold. RD estimates of the MLDA have shown that legal access to alcohol increases mortality
(Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009), lowers academic performance (Carrell, Hoekstra and West, 2011;
Lindo,SwensenandWaddell,2013),increasescrime(CarpenterandDobkin,2015),andincreases
theuseofmarijuanaandtobacco(Dee,1999;CrostandGuerrero,2012),amongstothers.
In this paper, we expand the literature in two ways, using several novel datasets on U.S. Army
soldiers. First, we examine outcomes that have not yet been studied in the context of the MLDA,
including suicidal tendencies, psychological health, physical fitness, job-related infractions, and
fitness for combat deployment. Second, we explore heterogeneity in the impacts of alcohol in
terms of potential risk factors, including self-control, depression, coping ability, cognitive ability,
andafamilyhistoryofmentalhealthproblemsorsubstanceabuse.

able dimensions of soldier health, fitness, and job performance. However, this conclusion must
be qualified by the limitations of our data and empirical setting. First, as with any RD around the
MLDA, we are only able to look at the subset of individuals around their 21st birthday. While al-

looking at the long-term impact of alcohol consumption and from examining outcomes that may
take time to manifest. Finally, despite our wealth of data, there are other important short-term
outcomes that we do not observe, such as death, hospitalizations, and accidents. Nonetheless, our
study adds important outcomes to a growing body of work of credible estimates of the effects of
alcohol consumption, and demonstrates the importance of recognizing the variation in risk factors

2. Data and Sample
2.1 Data
Our population is U.S. Army enlisted soldiers, and our data come from personnel records
and routine health assessments that are collected on all enlisted soldiers. The Master Personnel
File identifies the set of soldiers of an age close to their 21st birthday and contains their demo-
graphic information such as birthdate, gender, race/ethnicity, the Armed Forces Qualifying Test
(AFQT) score, and educational attainment. We merge the Master Personnel File to several other
person-level databases which contain additional information on mental, physical, and behavioral
outcomes.
Periodic Health Assessment. The Periodic Health Assessment (PHA) is a required annual
assessment that is used primarily to screen for health problems and determine if a solider is fit for
a combat deployment. Some of the data in the PHA is measured by a clinician, and some is self-
reported by the service member. The clinically measured data include height, weight, vision and
hearing ability, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. The self-reported data come from questions
about current and past health symptoms and diseases, alcohol and tobacco use, behavioral and
mentalhealthhistory,andfamilyhistoryofmentalhealthproblemsandchemicaldependency.
SoldiersareinformedthattheelementsofthePHAwillnotbesharedwiththeirsuperiors,and
only used to assess their fitness for deployment. Nonetheless, it is possible that soldiers are not

All soldiers are required to take the assessment yearly through an online module. They are told
explicitly that their responses are confidential and will not be seen by their superiors. In contrast
to the PHA, there is less reason to believe that soldiers would not be truthful on the GAT as there

Other Administrative Databases Physical fitness data come from the Digital Training Man-
agementSystem(DTMS),andincludescoresfromtherequiredannualassessmentsofthreeevents:
push-ups, sit-ups, and a 2-mile run. Lastly, we obtain records of all infractions recorded in a sol-
dier’sofficialfilefromtheinteractiveElectronicRecordsofManagementSystem(iPERMS).This
data contains both judicial proceedings (i.e., court martial) as well as minor breaches of military
conduct.
2.2 Outcomes
Next we describe the outcome measures that are drawn from these various databases. We ex-
aminetheimpactsoflegalaccesstoalcoholonbothsoldiers’drinkingbehaviorandoutcomesthat
are known to be correlated with alcohol consumption or could potentially be influenced by alco-
hol consumption. Theoretical mechanisms through which alcohol could influence these outcomes
includecompromisedjudgmentandimpairedphysicaland/ormotorskills.
Alcohol consumption. We define four measures of alcohol consumption from questions on
the PHA. The first question is: How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?, to which the
soldiercanrespond: “never”,“monthlyorless”,“2-4timesamonth”,“2-3timesaweek”,or“4or
more times a week.” From this, we define an indicator for whether a person drinks alcohol. Given
the vagueness of the text, it is unclear whether this question is asking about whether a person has
ever drankalcohol,orwhethertheyhavedrankalcoholrecently. Itisworthnotingthatamongour
under-21 sample, close to 13% of the soldiers had consumed alcohol. We also calculate from this
question the proportion of days in which a person drinks, constructing the measure logically from
responses. For example, those who reported drinking “monthly or less” are assigned a value of
1/30,thosewhoreport“2-4timesamonth”areassigned3/30,andsoforth.

"THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL ON MENTAL HEALTH, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND JOB PERFORMANCE.pdf,page:7","If the answer to the first question is anything other than “never”, the respondent proceeds to
answer about the intensity of their drinking behavior. They were next asked How many drinks
containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you are drinking? (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9, or
10+), from which we define a linear variable of the number of drinks on a typical drinking day,
imputing the midpoint of the category ranges and coding ”10+” as 10 drinks. Finally, respondents
wereasked: Howoftendoyouhavesixormoredrinksononeoccasion? (never,lessthanmonthly,

similarmannertotheproportionofdrinkingdays.
Tobaccouse. Paststudieshavedocumentedthatalcoholuseandtobaccousehavecommonrisk
factors (Verdejo-Garc´ıa, Lawrence and Clark, 2008). Using responses from the PHA, we define
three measures of smoking on both the extensive and intensive margins. On the extensive margin,
soldiers were asked Do you use any kind of tobacco products?; close to 30% of those under 21
years old reported they do. On the intensive margin, smokers were first asked about the number

three questions about their level of nicotine dependency that, along with the number of cigarettes

smoking in places where it is forbidden; Do you smoke more frequently in the morning; and Do
you smoke even if you are sick in bed most of the day. The Fagerstrom score ranges from 0 to 10,

Depression and suicide ideation. Alcohol use been shown to be correlated with both major
depression and suicide ideation (Wang and Patten, 2001; Fergusson, Boden and Horwood, 2009;
LeardMann etal., 2013; Fuehrlein etal., 2016; Thompson andSwartout, 2017). However,there is
no evidence to date on the causal pathways at play. The PHA contains nine screening questions
for depression which ask about mood and behavior in the last two weeks. Following the Army’s
psychologicalhealthreferralguideline,wedefineasoldiertobeatriskofclinicaldepressionifhe
answered “more than half the days” or “nearly every day” to at least one of these nine questions.2

following problems? (1) Little interest or pleasure in doing things? (2) Feeling down, depressed or hopeless? (3)

Job-related infractions. Our final set of outcomes identify all recorded breaches of military
conduct or regulation. There is evidence from non-military populations that crime increases with
legal access to alcohol (Carpenter and Dobkin, 2011), with the plausible pathway being alcohol

The iPERMS database contains various levels of offenses varying in severity. We classify
these offense records into three categories, and consider offenses of each type separately, as well
as an aggregate measure of having committed any offense. A level 1 offense is a minor offense
known as a “letter of reprimand.” It is recorded by the soldier’s commanding officer for a broad
range of behaviors deemed unbecoming of a military service member, such as insubordination, an
initial report of sexual harassment, or disorderly conduct. These types of offenses do not result in
punishments,buttheletterstaysonthesoldier’spersonnelrecordandmayaffectfuturepromotions
or assignments. A level 2 offense is when a soldier goes through proceedings under Article-15 of

decide to process him under Article-15 or bring formal charges. Article-15 proceedings can result
in punishments (such as demotion, confinement, jail time for no more than 30 days, extra duties),
but do not result in a criminal record. Soldiers who undergo Article-15 proceedings do not go
through a formal adjudication process (although soldiers have the right to request a full military
legal trial). Finally, a level 3 offense is one which the commanding officer deems serious enough
tomeritafulljudicialhearing,knownasmilitarycourtmartial. Ifconvictedunderacourtmartial,
the soldier will have a criminal record and receive punishments that range from demotion, fines,
jail time or dishonorable discharge (which affect his post-military benefits). One thing to keep in
mind is that while we can classify types of offenses, our data does not indicate the nature of any
offense. Offenses are relatively rare, with only 3.4% of the under-21 sample having at least one
offense.
2.3 SampleSelection

3.1 HeterogeneityAnalysis
A novel contribution of our analysis is that we are able to estimate the heterogeneous impacts
of the MLDA in terms of risk factors for alcohol consumption. We explore the following five
dimensions of heterogeneity, using soldier’s score on that dimension before they turned 21 years
old.
Depression, Self-control, and Coping Ability. In our main analysis, we consider depression,
self-control, and coping ability as outcomes that may be be affected by alcohol use; however, the
direction of causality could run the other way, whereby these psychological attributes are the risk

5 questions. Respondents were asked to rate on a 5-point scale (from “not at all” to “every day”)
how often in the past four weeks they were bothered by any of the problems listed. Examples of
the problems include “Feeling down, depressed or hopeless,” and “Feeling very angry.” 4 We take

Armed Forces Qualifying Test percentile. The AFQT percentile is computed based on test
scoresfromthefollowingaptitudetests: arithmeticreasoning,mathematicsknowledge,paragraph
comprehension, and word knowledge. The Army uses results from these tests to assign soldiers
to suitable military occupation. It is normalized so the AFQT scores are reported as percentiles
between 1 and 99. The U.S. Army requires a minimum score of 31 on the AFQT for a person to
be enlisted. A score below 31 would require a waiver. As Table 1 shows, the average AFQT score
inoursampleis56.

soldierwasaskedtoidentifywhethertheirparents,grandparent,and/orsiblingshadmentalhealth

4.1 TheimpactofMLDAonalcoholconsumption
We first examine the impact of legal access to alcohol on self-reported alcohol consumption.
Figure2presentsfourdifferentmeasuresofalcoholconsumptionamongstsoldiersinthe180days

means suggest that the quadratic parameterization fits the data reasonably well. We confirm this
with the F−statistic described above, which tests the null hypothesis that the polynomial model
hasasmuchexplanatorypowerasthefullyflexible(non-parametric)model.
The top left panel of Figure 2 shows that approximately 13% of soldiers report having drank
any alcohol prior to their 21st birthday. The bottom left panel shows that soldiers consume very
little prior to turning age 21, on average about a third of a drink (this measure includes those who
do not drink as drinking 0 drinks). The top right and bottom right panels of Figure 2 show that
amongst those who drink at all, the proportion of drinking days is very low and the proportion of
bingedrinkingdays(havingsixormoredrinksononeoccasion)isevenlower.

our regression model does not distinguish between the post-birthday ramp-up in drinking and the
eventual plateau. For example, the RD point estimate for drinking at all is 9.5 percentage points,
which is an increase of 74.8% (=0.095/0.127) even though 2 months after the 21st birthday the
increaseoverthepre-21rateisover5-fold(˜13%to˜70%).
It is worth noting that these estimates of the impact of the MLDA on alcohol consumption
are slightly larger than those found amongst both the U.S. population as a whole (a 6 percentage
pointincreasefoundinCarpenterandDobkin(2009)usingtheNationalHealthInterviewSurvey)
and the U.S. college student population (a 6.5 percentage point increase found in Lindo, Swensen
and Waddell (2013) using the NLSY 97). The pre-21 alcohol consumption we observe amongst
11"
"THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL ON MENTAL HEALTH, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND JOB PERFORMANCE.pdf,page:14","soldiers is also lower than has been reported in the civilian population. These low rates could be
reflecting under-age soldiers’ unwillingness to report alcohol use: soldiers may not know, or not
believe, that the PHA is not shared with their direct superiors. However, young soldiers generally
live on bases with limited access to alcohol and face strict penalties for drinking under the legal

Figure3presentsvisualevidenceofthechangeinselectedoutcomesaroundthe21stbirthday.
As with the alcohol consumption measures, the quadratic parametric specifications fit the data
reasonably well (this is also confirmed by the F- statistics described above). Table 2 contains RD
estimatesofallofouroutcomesofinterest.
By and large, we observe no systematic differences in any of the outcomes we study for sol-
diers before and after the 21st birthday. That is, virtually all of these RD estimates are small in
magnitude, precisely estimated (standard errors are small, partially stemming from the large sam-
ple sizes), and statistically indistinguishable from zero.6 For instance, in the PHA sample, 29.7%
ofthesoldiersreportedbeingasmokerjustbeforetheyturned21. Theestimatedimpactofturning
age 21 is to increase the prevalence of smoking by 2.2 percentage points, but this estimate is not
statistically distinguishable from 0. Our finding on smoking is consistent with Yo¨ru¨k and Yo¨ru¨k
(2011)whoshowthattheMLDAhasasmallandinsignificantimpactoncigarette(andmarijuana)

That our estimates of the impacts of MLDA are indistinguishable from zero are also not being
drivenbythebaselinemean. Forinstance,93.3%ofsoldiersareclassifiedas“Fitfordeployment”
prior to turning 21. The RD estimate of turning 21 is to lower this percentage by 0.8 percentage
points, but then again the estimate is not statistically different from zero. We do find that the
impact of the MLDA on job-related infractions (“Any offense”) is significant at the 5 percent
level (and is driven by level 1 offenses), but is extremely small in magnitude and economically
insignificant. Thisisinpartduetothelow-frequencynatureofthisevent,whichiswhywepresent

job-relatedinfractionspost-21.
4.3 Heterogeneityofthealcoholaccesseffectbyriskfactors
The null results we described in the previous section might mask potential negative impacts
of alcohol access experienced by certain segments of the population. Next, we analyze the extent
to which soldiers’ baseline psychological and cognitive profiles, as measured by the five traits
described in section 3.1, might act as mediating factors in the impact of alcohol consumption on
behavioraloutcomes.
Inpractice,wesplitoursampleintothetopquartile,interquartilerange,andthebottomquartile
for coping ability, depression, self control, and AFQT score, and into those with and without a
familyhistoryofsubstanceuse/mentalhealthproblems. WethenestimatetheRDmodelseparately
for each group. In addition, the sample size does not distribute exactly as 25%, 50%, and 25%
across the three quartile ranges, due to the discrete nature of the scores. However, all results are
robusttootherparameterizationsofthesevariables.
Figures 4–8 show that there is substantial differences in the pre-21 means of drinking and the
other outcomes by the five dimensions of heterogeneity we study. For example, Figure 4 shows
thatover15%ofthosewhoseself-controlscoreisinthebottomquartiledrinksalcoholbeforethey
turn 21, compared to only 10% from the top quartile. Those in the bottom quartile are also more
likely to screen positive for depression (11% in the bottom quartile versus 5% in the top quartile),
to have thoughts of self harm (0.9% versus 0.4%) and to commit offenses (2 per 10,000 soldiers
on a given day in the bottom quartile versus 1.3 in the top quartile). We observe similar patterns
when we examine pre-21 means of the outcomes by the distribution of coping ability (Figure 5)
andofbaselinedepression(Figure6).
Differencesinpre-21outcomesareparticularlynoticeablebetweensoldierswithandwithouta
family history of mental health problems or chemical dependencies. In particular, Figure 8 shows
that, before soldiers turned 21, those with a family history are more than 3 times more likely to
be screened positive for depression (5% among those without family history versus 18% among
those with family history of mental health problems of chemical dependency), more than 3 times
morelikelytohavesuicidalthoughts(0.5%versus1.7%)andtocommitanoffense(0.6per10,000

(1.6 per 10,000 soldier on a given day versus 1.1). One thing to note is that across all 5 traits, we
generally do not see differences in physical outcomes (total fitness score and fit for deployment)
bythedistributionofthetrait.
ThesepatternsaregenerallyconsistentwiththedescriptivefindingsinMarsden(2014),which

adjusting for demographics and other factors, they find that prevalence of suicide ideation is sig-
nificantly related to depression symptoms and avoidance coping. Marsden (2014) also find heavy
drinkingisnotsignificantlyrelatedtoactivecoping.
Table 3 report estimates of the causal impact of legal access to alcohol on selected outcomes
(theremainingoutcomesarereportedinAppendixTable5forefficiency). Eachcolumnrepresents
a separate RD model for that sub-sample of soldiers. For example, when we categorize soldiers
by their baseline depression score, the RD estimates show that those who score in the bottom
quartile of depression have larger response to MLDA (probability of drinking goes up by 0.13,
p<0.01) than those in the top quartile (probability of drinking goes up by 0.05, p>0.10). We also
observelargerresponsesamongthosewithfamilyhistoryofmentalhealthorchemicaldependency
problems(RDestimatesare0.08versus0.17,bothp<0.05). Interestingly,thosewithbettercoping
ability have larger responses to MLDA than those in the bottom quartile of coping (0.12, p<0.05
versus 0.076, p>0.1); and those in the top quartile of AFQT distribution also have larger response
toMLDAthanthoseinthebottomquartile(0.148versus0.088,p<0.05forboth).
The stratified analysis on drinking outcomes suggest that MLDA mainly affects those with
better cognitive ability (better AFQT and coping skills)–soldiers who are likely to be workers
with better productivity to start with and are better equipped to cope with the stressful military
environment. As a result, we might not expect to see significant loss in worker job performance
whenthesesoldiersgainlegalaccesstoalcohol.
Indeed, when we examine the non-drinking outcomes, we find no significant negative or posi-
tive impacts of turning 21. However, part of the null finding might be due to the low frequency of
the outcomes. For example, the RD estimates for suicidal thoughts is 0.003 (i.e., 0.3 percentage
pointincreaseoffabaserateof0.6%)forthosewithoutfamilyhistoryand0.024(i.e.,2.4percent-
agepointincreaseoffabaserateof2.3%)forthosewithfamilyhistoryofmentalhealthproblems
or chemical dependency. Even though the magnitude of the estimate is fairly large in the practical
sense, the standard errors are also very large due to the fact that very few soldiers reported having

manipulating (sorting into) when they take the PHA, PFT, and GAT to either before or after their
21st birthday; and that alcohol consumption is indeed impacted upon gaining legal access after
one’s21stbirthday.
For all practical purpose, there is no reason to believe that soldiers would purposefully choose
to take either assessment before or after turning 21, since soldiers do not reap any benefit whether
the assessments were taken before or after their birthday. Empirically, Figure 1 shows the distri-
bution of ages across all our samples when the tests were taken, and there does not appear to be
bunching before or after the 21st birthday. These figures suggest soldiers are not manipulating
when they take the PHA, GAT, and fitness test around their 21st birthday, thus verifying the first
assumption for RD validity. The results discussed in Section 4.1 clearly demonstrates that the
secondassumptionholdsaswell.
To check whether our null findings are statistical artifacts of our modeling choices, Appendix

outcomes, respectively, across six different models: linear, quadratic, and cubic specifications of
g(D) with and without controls of X as discussed in the Methods section above. These tables
also report the F-statistic and the mean values of the outcomes. These tables verify (1) that the
quadratic model is a good representation of our data and (2) that the results are robust to the
inclusionorexclusionofthecontrols.
In addition to verifying the robustness of our results to the inclusion of soldiers’ characteris-
tics, we can also test whether these characteristics themselves vary across the age 21 threshold.
Specifically, soldiers just under and over 21 should have baseline characteristics that are the same
on average. Figures 1 showed that soldiers are not selectively sorting when they take mental and
physical health and fitness assessments relative to their 21st birthday. This time we would like to
verify whether E(X|D) is continuous through their 21st birthday, at D=0. For instance, one may
worry that high cognitive ability soldiers disproportionately take the assessments after their 21st
birthday. To the extent that soldiers’ cognitive ability independently affect outcomes, this factor
couldinprincipleconfoundourestimatesofthetreatmenteffectoflegalaccesstoalcohol.

samples). To the extent that these discontinuities are real, an increase in the share of women at 21
would lead us to understate the effects of MLDA on alcohol consumption at 21, since women on
average drink less than men. Given that we do not find significant negative effects of MLDA on
otherbehavioraloutcomes,wearenotconcernedaboutthegenderimbalanceacrossage21.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we estimate the impact of legal access to alcohol on a wide range of behavioral
and physical outcomes of young U.S. Army soldiers, and we explore whether these impacts vary
withriskfactorsforalcoholabuse.
Using data on all soldiers between 2009 and 2015, we observe a large and significant increase
in drinking after the 21st birthday overall, and the increases are largest amongst those who were
depressed, had a family history of mental health problems, had better coping ability, and had
highercognitiveability. Despitethelargeincreaseinconsumption,wedonotfindanymeaningful

health,deployability,smoking,andjob-relatedinfractions.
Howdoourresultsaddtothecurrentknowledgeofdrinkingbehaviorsinthemilitary? Drink-
ing and use of tobacco products have long been part of the military culture (Oster et al., 2012).
Alcohol is even used by unit leaders as a way to build unit cohesion and reward the completion of
difficult tasks. As one USMC sergeant recounted in a New York Times Op-Ed of his experience,
beer consumption and underage drinking are common within the barracks even though alcohol is
prohibitedinsidethemilitarycompound(Brennan,2012). Soldiersdoknowtheywillgetpunished
if they get caught drinking underage or drinking hard alcohol within the barracks. Thus, it makes
sense that using data from the military workplace, we find increases in alcohol have no meaning-
ful impact on soldiers’ physical and mental health and adverse behaviors, even as attaining legal
accessincreasedtheirconsumption.
Whilethenullfindingsonthissetofshort-termoutcomesareencouragingfromapublichealth
viewpoint, and perhaps suggest that soldiers are drinking responsibly, more information is needed

important short-term outcomes such as injury or death, which have been shown to increase with

Drugs, Alcohol, and Aging
EDITH S. LlSANSKY GOMBERG
1. DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE ELDERLY
Although developmental psychology used to stop abruptly after infancy, childhood, and
adolescence had been described, there has been, for some decades now, increasing
awareness and increasing research activity in the biological, psychological, and social
aspects of adult life: young adults, middle-aged adults, elderly adults. The last group,
defined here as 65 and older, is one stage (obviously the last stage) in the lifespan, and
demographic data have pointed up the fact that this group represents an increasing
proportion of the population of developed nations. In the early 1980s, this age group
constituted 9.3% of the Canadian population (Fact Book on Aging in Canada, 1983) and
11-12% of the U.S. population (A Profile of Older Americans, 1986). Demographers
predict an increasing proportion of elderly in the population, projecting their specula
tions into the early decades of the 21st century.
We speak of ""the elderly"" or ""the pensioners"" or ""retirees"" as though these are
homogeneous groupings. Most research attention has, in the past, concentrated on the
differentiation between sick and well, on morbidity and mortality, although the rela
tively healthy segment of the older population represents a wide range of behaviors,
habits, cognitions, personalities, attitudes, values, and even health status (Rowe and
Kahn, 1987). Some hold the view that heterogeneity is even wider in this age group than
in others. Whether this concept is valid or not, it is clear that everyone ages biologically,
psychologically, and socially at different intraindividual and interindividual rates. De
velopmental unevenness exists for children, adolescents, and young adults, and it exists
for older adults as well.
Part of the challenge of gerontology is to study and differentiate between ""normal""
aging and ""abnormal"" aging, and the assumption that all aging processes involve loss
and impairment is being questioned. Rowe and Kahn (1987) distinguish between usual

aging and successful aging. Usual aging is normative in affluent societies and involves
the heightening of the effects of aging by ""extrinsic"" factors. In successful aging, loss
and impairment may be minimized by factors such as nutrition, exercise, continued
activity, and social involvement. Successful aging, seen in the late work of major
creative artists, was described recently as "" ... art born in the fullness of age"" (Rus
sell, 1987).
It hardly seems necessary to examine cross-cultural data and compare traditional
agricultural societies with industrialized societies, as suggested by Rowe and Kahn
(1987), to make this distinction. Within Canada and the United States, women are
longer-lived than men, and the greater longevity of women may well be explained not
only in terms of biological and physiological sex differences, but in terms of different
role behaviors which encourage women to pay more attention to their health, to maintain
activity in domestic roles, and to remain socially involved-thus increasing the like
lihood of successful aging. It has been hypothesized that the greater longevity of women
is linked to sex role and to greater adaptability to change (Gomberg, 1979).
The older population is indeed heterogeneous, and we may start with age dif
ferences. Persons defined as elderly may be of any age between 65 and 95, a 3D-year,
three-decade span. We speak now of ""the frail elderly,"" meaning the oldest in that age
group who have more or less difficulty in maintaining themselves. There has already
been a classification into ""young old"" and ""old old,"" and there is likely to be further
subdivision.
There are racial and cultural variations in the aging process and the development
of a research area called ethnogerontology (Jackson, 1985). Ethnic study includes not
only those groups called ""minorities,"" but variations in behaviors and customs among
people whose families originate in different European, Asian, and African countries,
and elderly people who practice different religions (Gelfand and Barresi, 1987). Mem
bership and participation in different ethnic subgroups play a major role in social
networking, community participation, and the use of health services (Gelfand, 1982).
There are also regional differences in the percentage of elderly in the population, in life
styles, and in services available in the different provinces and states of Canada and the
United States.
Examining the marital status and the economic status ofthe elderly shows interest
ing gender differences. In 1985, older men were twice as likely to be married as older
women. For the United States, the percentages were 77% of the men and 40% of the
women. For Canada, the same is true: In Toronto, for example, the 1981 census showed
76% of men, 65 and older, to be married, and 36.1 % of the same age women (A Socio
Demographic Profile of the Elderly, 1984). In the United States, 51% of all older
women are widows and there are five times as many widows as widowers. The Fact
Book on Aging in Canada (1983) sums it up: "" ... Most older men are married while
most older women are widowed."" Marital status is, of course, associated with living
arrangements: 41 % of older women and 15% of older men in the United States live
alone. The same holds true for the Canadian elderly (Stone and Fletcher, 1981). The
economic status of the elderly is a complex subject embracing earned income, social
security, pensions, housing arrangements, and the definition of poverty level. But one
aspect of economic status that stands out clearly is gender difference. Older women have
higher rates of poverty than older men in the United States: 16% and 8%, respectively."
